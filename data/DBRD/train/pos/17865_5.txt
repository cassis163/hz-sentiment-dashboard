â€œNever Flinch.' A cold whisper in her ear. 'Never fear. And never, ever forget."

My heart... I'm going to need a minute to process everything I just read... what a book!
I definitely found a new favorite!

Mia's familia is killed by 3 people when she was just 10 years old.
Now she is 16 and hell bent on revenge. Her way of getting it? Joining a school for killers of course!

Although it took me a while to get into this book, the start is very confusing, I fell in love with it and I fell hard! I totally didn't expect the events in the last few chapters of this book though and although I absolutely loved it, as it made this story freakin' awesome, I don't know if my heart will ever recover...
