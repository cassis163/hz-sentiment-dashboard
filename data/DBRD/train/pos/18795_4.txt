Cress is a shell and was supposed to be killed when she was just a baby, but instead she has been held captive, on her own, in a satellite, for 7 years, looking down on earth, while doing the Lunar Queens bidding. She finally has enough and rebels, trying to get rescued by the rogue cyborg Cinder and her escaped criminal friend Carswell Thorne. When they come for her, her captor finds out and everybody gets waist deep into trouble... I love this series so much! It's still a toss up between Scarlet and Cress for my favorite. Both Wolf and Thorne are just so well written. Wolf is broody and mysterious and Thorne... oh, he's just so cheecky and funny! I love both of them to pieces :)
