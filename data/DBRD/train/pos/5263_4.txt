I really enjoyed this book! It takes place in Halifax (Canada) and that's a nice change from big city America. The story is a mix of legal thriller, medical mistery and some (sometimes a bit silly) romantic content. It's actually as if Kate swoons over almost every male she meets (or the other way around) and she seems to have a rather lousy judgement of their characters: her arrogant dog-hating ex, her boss and the dogwalker she just met. The story is really original and well put together. Once I started reading, it was hard to put the book down. And I'm definetly interested in the other books of this series.
