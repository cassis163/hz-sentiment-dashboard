Neverwhere - Neil Gaiman

He had gone beyond the world of metaphor & simile into the place of things that are, and it was changing him ....

I have no clue what it is about Neverwhere that kept me reading, but I do know I really really enjoyed this book.
Eventhough the themes this tale touches upon are quit grown up, the way Neil Gaiman strings his words together read like a deliciously dark fairytale.

In this book the villains turned out to be far more interesting than even the protagonist. My favorite character will forever be Marquis de Carabas, in the book as well as in the tv series. Although he is a man of his word, he is also shady and sarcastic in the funniest way and you have to make sure he is not bamboozling you.

I think the reason I could not put the book down, is the fact that the plot was totally unpredictable and felt like it was all over the place ... In other words Neverwhere could end up just about anywhere. But in the end it turned out to not only have a decent plot but also one that wrapped up just enough to keep you wanting more ...

The writing is delightfully literary, but if you are not into batsh*t crazy ... this book might be hard to finish despite the magnificent words and phrases. However if you do not have a problem getting lost and are curious just how deep the rabbit hole goes ... by al means pick this one up.
