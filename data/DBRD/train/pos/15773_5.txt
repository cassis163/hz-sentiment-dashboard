This year, it is a match for Harry year.

He thinks he is then safe at Hogwarts, but appearances are deceiving. When his name comes from the Goblet of Fire, he is waiting for a match, he would never think of a volunteer to'd do it.

It's nice that J.K. not just wrote stories about Harry's life at Hogwarts, but that there also a championship is. This makes reading the Harry Potter books is enjoyable. Especially with Voldemort's returns.

It was get used to this book, in the beginning I did not like it, but I kept reading and finally out of it was getting better. Now I like all the Harry Potter books and all books are my favorite.
