“Better than chocolate, being with you last night. Silly me, I thought that nothing was better than chocolate. In a profound, symbolic gesture, I am giving you this bar of Vosges I got when we all went to Edgartown. You can eat it, or just sit next to it and feel superior.”

"I can't even say sorry," she tells me. "There is not even a Scrabble word for how bad I feel.” There isn’t a scrabble word to describe this book either. It’s strange, compelling, brutal, sweet, naïve… all in once. From the very first pages, I was sucked into the story, even though both style and content seemed to be somewhat childish. As I got used to the short sentences and quirky style, the content grew more sinister. The author developed the storyline along the fine line between young adult and adult literature. The result is a cool, dispassionate narration of a fractured family. Although the lack of knowledge about the characters and their circumstances adds to the mystery, the story remains a bit too superficial for my taste. ‘We were Liars’ is certainly a suspenseful read, if not a literary masterpiece. From an adult point of view I would rate this book 3 stars, but as YA it’s worth 4 stars.
