In the series "Palandins of Jack Vance" the novel Phaedra: Alastor 824 by the Dutch writer Tais teng. This novel takes places in Jack Vance’s well beloved story universe of the Alastor books: the far flung future where humanity has spread between the stars and every planet has developed its own unique culture. The young Gunnar arrives with his mother on Pahedra, Alastor 824, a planet where mysterious Elder Galleons sail the equatorial canal and where the inhabitants of every picturesque metropole consider all others mere bumpkins. Two girls catch Gunnar’s heart, the tricky Lavoine who is the last Voodoo queen, and Semele the huntress who is only interested in a boy who is worthy. But when Lovoine is trying to wake up the Elder, the aliens who once moved whole planets and wrote messages on the surface with mountain ranges, things get interesting.

Tais Teng writes a great, colorful novel which is worthy to be called a complement to the books of Jack Vance. It has grand, weird cultures and customs. A great, engaging adventure which was a lot of fun to read. I hope to read more of these books in the future.
