I loved this so much, the perfect conclusion of Feyre and Rhys's story.

The story of Feyre and Rhys continues in this final installment of this trilogy.
As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords â€“ and hunt for allies in unexpected places.

This book was intriguing and had me totally sucked in, although it took me a while to get into the story.
I was totally going to give it a 5 star review, but at the end I was a bit disappointed about a few story lines not being completed.

What about Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the sisters?
And Lucien? I loved that character, but we only get to see him in half the book, before he's off on a very important mission, we don't get to hear anything about...
I heard there are going to be more books set in Prythian and I'm hoping they will satisfy my need for more info on the characters besides Feyre and Rhys!
