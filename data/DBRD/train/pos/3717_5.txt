Sky Beaumont, took me on a journey to explore Arnhem in a way I didn't look to Arnhem in normal life. Every day I had to read!, to see what was happening the book kept catching my attention till the end. It was great for me visualization how Sky was travelling through Arnhem. Sky visited a lot of known places for me, but also interested me for some unknows.

Obvious the first book I read was "The bridge too far" showing the history of Arnhem.
I am not a regular reader of English books, but this was great reading and boosting my English vocabulary (and a few Australian slang words).
