The Versions of us has been compared to books like One Day, Life after Life and The Post-Birthday World, books I loved reading. I had high expectations and Laura Barnett delivered the goods.
What would have happened to our lives, if we would at one point in time have made another decision, moved in another direction. Laura Barnett tries to answer the question by drawing three storylines from one decisive moment in Jim’s and Eva’s life. The result is a clever, wonderful book that I will have to reread several times to fully grasp. The story covers more than 60 years and I really had to stay focused to get my head around every storyline.
The versions of us is beautifully written. Although the main characteristics of Eva and Jim remain the same in each storyline, small details create utterly different stories, each time surprising me and urging me to read on. I love how Barnett uses the three versions of Eva and Jim’ life to create a realistic story that shows both the good and the bad in life, in growing old. Life is full of coincidences and chances we will or won’t take, it’s impossible to predict how things will turn out.
I highly recommend this impressive debut, but make enough time for it. This is not a book to read in between chores.
