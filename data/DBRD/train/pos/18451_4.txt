Ok, so I have to bump this up to a 4* read.
I really enjoyed it this time and Winter wasn't as annoying. She is still my least favorite character, but if you don't pay to much attention to her, the rest of the story was really good!

I did feel everything ended a little too nicely, but overall... a good conclusion to a wonderful series :D
