I'm enjoying this trilogy of companion novels so much!
This one was every bit as enjoyable and action packed as the first one, but it didn't have an annoying plot twist at the end *YAY*

Jubilee is Captain in the military, stationed on Avon to keep the peace.
Flynn is a leader of the rebels, trying to win the planet back from the military, so his people can live in peace.
They are on opposite sides, but that doesn't stop them joining forces and falling in love.

Yes! What a nice sequel :D
I love the easy, flowing writing style and combined with an action packed plot line, a bit of romance (but not too much soppy stuf), it makes for a gripping read.
Come on, there are daring rebels, though military people and whispers in this, how can you not love this?
