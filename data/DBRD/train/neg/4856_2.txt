The story is about Hazel, she is 16 and has cancer. Her parents are afraid that they will become lonely and depressed and have given her a support group. There she meets a boy Gus, together they make before it is for one of them to leave a good time.

I found the soup to a juicy story, I could not find me, and sometimes I thought, put the book away. It's a shame because it could have been a great story, but unfortunately this was not so. Both the English and the Dutch, I found nothing.
