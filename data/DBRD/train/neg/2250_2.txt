Edna O'Brien is a good writer and I read and liked The Country Girls many years ago. This book just didn't do it for me. None of the characters came to life for me. I can't identify with any of them. I really disliked Fidelma and even though that is not a bad thing in literary fiction, because you don't always have to like the main characters, she didn't do anything for me. I absolutely can't recommend this book. There are better books out there about refugees and the situation in the Balkan countries.
