If you want to know how a story about identical twins with psychic powers who create chaos by predicting an earthquake can be boring, try reading this novel. I don't think all characters should be likeable, but if an author pictures them as annoyingly shallow, whining creatures, the plot or writing style should make up for it. No such luck. In the end Sittenfeld seemed to be completely fed up with writing this book and just wanted it to end no matter what. Conclusion: a book that starts out fine, becomes increasingly boring and ends so ridiculous it felt like a waste of time reading it.
