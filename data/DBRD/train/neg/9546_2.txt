After reading so many positive reviews, I really wanted to like this book. I kept on reading because I wanted to know how it all would end, but the story never really touched me. The multiple narrative slowed down the pace as the same events were told from different perspectives over and over again. The book is an easy read and the plot is intriguing, but the slow pace and too many clichés bothered me. I don’t think I will read more of Heather Gudenkauf's work in future.
