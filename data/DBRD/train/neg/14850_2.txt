Normally I avoid thrillers, but since I liked Before I go to Sleep, I was willing to give this book a go. Unfortunately Second Life represents everything I don’t like about thrillers. I thought most of the book was shallow and unrealistic. I don’t think characters have to be likeable to make a work worthwhile, but the motives used to explain the characters’ actions were utterly unbelievable. The only remaining explanation for the main character’s choices is stupidity. About half way in the novel I was thinking about throwing it aside because it was too boring to keep on reading. I wished I had, because the ending was absolutely unsatisfying.
