Well... that was... underwhelming...
I really, really wanted to like this book and went in thinking I would absolutely love it.
Maybe I just set my expectations to high, but I found this book to be.. meh... all the way through.

I started this as an audio book, but the weird voices the narrator used made me cringe the entire time, so I switched to the e-book after 3 chapters.
Although it upped my reading enjoyment a lot, it didn't make me change my mind about the content...

The premise sounded really good: a world were time is currency and people found a way to bleed years from their veins, bind it to iron to make it possible for human consumption and in that way add time to your lifespan.
We follow Jules, who fled Everless with her father years ago, but sees no other way to save her father than to return to the city were she will never be safe...

Sounds cool right? I thought so too!
But... this story felt like I've read it a million times before.

Jules was an ok protagonist at most (bring on the special snowflake, who doesn't know she has special powers), her love interest, Roan, had nothing going for him, besides the fact that Jules used to know him and he was gorgeous and the story was, although well written, plain boring.
The big twist at the end was not surprising, I predicted it in chapter 1...

The only thing I did like, was the "bad guy", Liam.
But... like the rest of this book, I predicted he'd turn out to be not so bad from the first moment he entered the story.

I wanted to DNF this book so many times, but a couple of friends, who's opinion I trust, told me that it would get better... unfortunately for me, it didn't...
