Pick your poison is the fifth book of the Ruby Redfort series. This review is from a readers perspective that hasn't followed this series.

Ruby Redfort is thirteen-years old with super high intelligence. Being a genious as she is, she works for Spectrum as a undercover agent and code cracker. She remembers every single detail she comes across, because you'll never know when you might need it or maybe even saves your life.

What I expected from this book is that it would be exciting, thrilling and would really get me caught up in it. Well, this sadly did not happen. There were many characters in this book that I did not quite follow. Maybe this has to do with the fact that I haven't read the other remaining books, but maybe there should've been a little more of an explanation or clarification. There were many things that happened in the past that I in first glance didn't follow. For example the book started off with a flashback which first was a little confusing.

This book got plottwists and so it gets a little more movement. It gets speed up a little more, you'll get to know the characters a little bit better which makes the book a little more fun.

Event though this book didn't fit my ally and was a little too thick, it's an easy read. It was okay, I wouldn't read any of the other books actually. I think that maybe if I had followed the series, it would'nt be so chaotic.
