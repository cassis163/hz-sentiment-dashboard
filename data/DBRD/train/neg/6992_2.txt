Although this book describes only 4 days out of the life of a 10 year old boy, this book is 1226 pages.
It's about Gurion Maccabee who has been kicked out of several schools and is now in a special program called The Cage program.
He is way too smart for his ages, is an extremely good writer and he becomes the leader of all the children in the Cage. They see him as a leader and he sees himself as a messias.
There are several other lines in the book: he is in love with June and he takes that very serious, the relationship with his parents, his mother is a psychologist, his father a lawyer who defends a nazi although the family are isrealists.
According to reviewers this book reminds of Gunter Grass The tin drum, Philop Roth Portnoy's complaint, William Goldings Lord of the Flies and of Anthony Burgess' A clockwork Orange.
I don't agree with that. There are funny parts in this book, but sometimes it goes on and on about the childish behaviour of Gurion.
Don't know very well what to think about this book. I'm glad it's finished.
