2 stars for the story... I really wished it was a lot more as the idea/impression the blurb gave of the book was very promising and could really make a good story. Unfortunately the whole story is nothing more than one great journey/chase (and not a convincing one) to rescue the girl's mother while shouting out very regularly that the wolf wilder girl, Feo, isn't afraid of anything. And that's it. The characters all stay extremely flat and it is a missed opportunity to not tell more about Russia a hundred years ago (it's history and country).
But worse if you put in the blurb the following: 'A wolf wilder is the opposite of an animal tamer: it is a person who teaches tamed animals to fend for themselves, and to fight and to run, and to be wary of humans.' than it's quite stupid to let Feo and her friend ride on them for hours and give them a lot 'not wolf like' roles in the story and tell nothing about their real way of living in nature.

I do give 5 stars for the illustrations, they were absolutely beautiful!!!
