I was a bit disappointed in this book, expected more of it. It's a true story about a young man who goes to war at WW II. After several already horrible events, he gets captured en is a prisoner of the Germans. He has to work in bad conditions at IG Farben at Auschwitz. There he sees people with pijama's who are in even worse shape en who get killed for nothing. He smells the dead of the gas chambers. At a certain moment, he wants to know more and see with his own eyes, so he changes clothes with a jew and goes to Auschwitz. The next day he returns and they switch again.
