I expected a deep, thought-provoking story, but read a light and girly book instead. The book started out strong and well-paced. Unfortunately it lost momentum very fast, making the larger part of the story rather dull. I would have preferred to read more about the actual experience of walking the PCT and its surroundings, instead of how tan and muscular the hiker was becoming and how much she was liked by everybody she met. There was just too much self-pity on each and every page to take her pain and sorrow serious. A lot of readers seem to like this book, but it just wasnâ€™t my thing.
