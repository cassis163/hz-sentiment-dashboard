Re-read March 2018

I'm having so much fun re-reading this series!
Even though my tastes have obviously changed, I still really enjoy these books :D

Celaena is now the King's Assassin and she does his bidding... or does she???

This was so much better than the first book!
The pacing was a lot better (not so slow and no boring bits) and I have to admit, I will always like Chaol!
3.5* this time :D

I loved this series so much! I do think the books get better as the story evolves and the first book is my least favorite, but still... I couldn't put any of them down and they all get a 5 star review!
If you haven't read anything by Sarah J. Maas, pick up one of her books asap!
