I’ve read and reread The Hobbit a couple of times now and each time it feels more and more like coming home. I was originally written and marketed as a children’s book, but not anymore. You could compare it with the last few volumes in the Harry Potter series: intended as children’s books, but widely read, not in the least by adults. The most ‘obvious’ aspect of The Hobbit that marks it as a children’s book is probably the fact that it is a standalone and that it is a solid adventure story: main character goes on an adventure, endures set-backs and losses and eventually returns home safe and sound.

That, however, wouldn’t do justice to Tolkien’s work. The fact that it is read and enjoyed by many is the fact that it has so many layers and connects with The Lord of the Rings so well. The characters, the songs, the stories-within-stories, the whole idea of Middle Earth: it is exceptionally well executed. It is in many ways more readable than The Lord of the Rings (especially the first two volumes), so it is a great start if you want to get acquainted with Tolkien’s work. I enjoy it more and more and I’m glad to have it in this beautiful edition!
