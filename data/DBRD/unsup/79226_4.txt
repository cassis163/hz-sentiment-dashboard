Re-read March 2018

This was so good!
The story of Aelin and her friends, or court, same thing in this series :) continues.
She sets out to find the keys so she can send Erawan back to his own world and close the door for good.

I really enjoyed the fact that we get a bit more back story in this book.
Not just from Aelin, but from all the characters.
And Lorcan... oh my... I know he's the "bad guy", but I love his and Elide's story.

What I didn't like about this book, is Aelin.
More specifically, I don't like the fact that she's always keeping her plans secret.
I know she does it to protect the ones she loves, but come on! You can't do everything alone, your plans are NOT always the best! Trust your friends! LET THEM HELP!

And Aedion... Although he is still my favorite character, I just can't get behind him being mad at Lysandra at the end of this book.
It's Aelin who conjured up this particular plan, be mad at her! Don't take it out on somebody who's just doing what her friend asked of her!
Dick move, general!

I loved this series so much! I do think the books get better as the story evolves and the first book is my least favorite, but still... I couldn't put any of them down!
If you haven't read anything by Sarah J. Maas, pick up one of her books asap!

This one kept me up until 2 in the morning and even then I had to force myself to go to sleep. I can't wait for part 6 to come out!
