Reread March 2018

After serving a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged out of the mines by the Crown Prince Dorian.
He offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.

They agree that if Celaena wins this competition, she'll serve the King for four years after which she'll be granted her freedom.

I have to admit, I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as the first time I read it.
The first half of the book was slow and kind of boring and when the action did start, it was good and I enjoyed it, but overall I just felt really... meh... about it.

This might be because I've already read the rest of the series and know what's about to happen and this first book is a bit bland compared to the others, but still... definitely not the 5* read I felt it was before.
I'm giving it 2.5* this time around, because I only enjoyed about half of the book, so half of the full 5 stars it is :)

-----------------------------------------------

I loved this series so much! I do think the books get better as the story evolves and the first book is my least favorite, but still... I couldn't put any of them down and they all get a 5 star review!
If you haven't read anything by Sarah J. Maas, pick up one of her books asap!
