I didn’t expect to like this book so much. I had read a lot of reviews about it and feared it would be too much of a romance story to keep my attention. Indeed, the story is sometimes written too compassionately, but I must confess that it worked: it made me put aside other things to keep turning pages. It is a strange experience, to enjoy reading about racism, hate, the civil rights movement. It made me think about the television series ‘I’ll fly away’, sitting comfortably on the couch watching serious topics made easy enough to entertain a lot of people, while at the same time showing horrible truths. The book cover is a good example of my hesitation to give this book more than three stars: important topics covered with a sweet pastel layer. I liked reading this book, but can’t help feeling there could have been more. Conclusion: ‘The Help’ may not be an accurate history lesson, but it is an absorbing story, well told.
