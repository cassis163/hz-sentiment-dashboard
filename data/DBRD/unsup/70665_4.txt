Story: 4/5 When she flees from the demons who burned down the home she lived in, she walks into a member of
the Shadow Clan who is able to kill those demons. The decision that has been made to travel together, things work out fine
for the both of them right?

Characters: 4/5 We follow two main characters; Yumeko, who was raised by monks and was told to bring the scroll to
safety within another temple, so that the monks there will be able to protect it.
And Kage, from the Shadow Clan (I was/am not sure to actually trust..). He is looking for a scroll, not knowing that ever since
they met, Yumeko has that certain scroll strapped to her body. This is not he only thing he doesn't know about her...

Writing: 4/5 I personally like it when words in another language are thrown in, but only when they add to the story.
And they did! And I loved how they added another layer to the story.

Reread: Yes, I think I will. Also want to read the next book in this trilogy.
