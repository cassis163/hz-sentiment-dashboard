I liked this book, but I was slightly disappointed as I was expecting so much after all the rave reviews

Feyre lives in a cabin in the forest with her father and 2 sisters. She hunts to provide food for her family. One day, she shoots and kills a wolf, who turns out to be Fey. In return for the life she took, she must give up her own and follow the Fey Tamlin across the border dividing the human and Fey world.

The first half of the book was just ok, but I did enjoy the second half.
It was action packed, fast paced and totally gripping!

The reason this book didn't live up to the hype for me is that I didn't like Tamlin... at all!
His character was a little flat, he needed a bit more background and depth in my opinion and he was just so passive when Feyre was doing the trials. I understand the reason behind it, but come on! The girl you love is risking her life for you and your court! Step up! At least TRY to help her or show some support!
Rhys did... Lucien did... you are supposed to be the man who loves her!

And the riddle... come on... who didn't guess the answer in about 3 seconds flat? I know I did!

I'm hoping the second book is better and the story goes in the direction I hope it does. If so, I know I'm going to absolutely love it!
