This is one of those books I had on my shelf for quite some time before actually reading it. The hype is just a little intimidating... it had to live up to some pretty high expectations and I was afraid there was no way this book was going to be as good as everybody made it out to be.

And to be honest, for the first 100 pages or so, this was a good book, a really good book, but not OH MY GOD!!! kind of good, so I got a little scared.

And then the rest of this book happenend... it was AMAZING!
There is a good reason why this book is so hyped up, because it truly is OH MY GOD!!!! good!

We follow 6 (duh... it's in the title... ) outcasts who get recruted to pull off the most difficult heist of all time!

The characters, the world building, the plot... everything is just so well thought out. I love Leigh Bardugo's writing style and the story builds up in such a way, that you just can't put this book down.

If you love an exciting story that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, pick this book up! Hell, if you just love a good book, read this one and you won't be dissapointed :)
