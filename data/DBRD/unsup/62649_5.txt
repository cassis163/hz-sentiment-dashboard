Vin is a street urchin, abandoned by everybody who was supposed to love her.
She tries to survive by always blending in to the background and staying with her thieving crew, helping them pull off their heists by somehow influencing the emotions of the people they're scamming.
When she meets a man named Kelsier and finds out the thing she's able to do, is actually Allomancy, she teams up with him and his crew to execute his outrageous plan to save the world from the Lord Ruler.

When a writer manages to create a perfectly written, complex world, with well developed, interesting characters, a magic system that is complex, but easy to understand and throws in a lot of political intrigue, solid friendships, just a tiny hint of romance and a lot of action packed scenes... well... you get the full, raving 5 stars from me!
