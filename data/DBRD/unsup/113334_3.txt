More like 3,5 stars. My least favorite of the trilogy. I enjoyed it, but it was a bit slow. It picked up naar the end though.

My favorite aspects: the characters and their dynamics and humor, I love me some sarcastic Noah :-)

My least favorite aspects: the slow pace and the ending; it would have been interesting to read about how the characters deal with their fate and what they have learned about it. The book ends at a point where the story gets interesting again.

I still recommend this trilogy, it's creepy, funny, keeps you guessing, has a great romance and... Noah Shaw, what more do you need!
