Michelle Obama declined to be directly interviewed for the book, but Slevin conducted dozens of interviews with her family members and friends, colleagues and former neighbors. He also drew on published and unpublished interviews and reports.


The result is a deeply informed portrait of the first lady and her native Chicago, particularly this city's often shameful treatment of African Americans. In the summer of 1966, Slevin writes, Martin Luther King Jr. led hundreds of white and black Chicago Freedom Movement marchers through the city's Marquette Park neighborhood. The civil rights leader was knocked to the ground by a rock hurled at his head, and the entire three-mile march was met with outrage, mayhem and violence.
This book is a revelation of what it is to be black, educated, a wife mother and dedicated civic leader, while incidentally being the dedicated wife of the President.
the narrative to be too wordy and detailed, bottom line, it painted a picture of a remarkable woman who has grown stronger and wiser from her trials and experiences
Now in her fifties, about to be free of the fish bowl of Pennsylvania Avenue, with daughters practically on their own, in excellent health, she has so much more she can accomplish, personally, for blacks and other disadvantage minorities and for the Country.
