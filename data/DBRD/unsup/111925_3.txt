THE FIRST FIFTEEN LIVES OF HARRY AUGUST by Claire North is a teaser. A wonderful premise where one lives the same life more than once and as a result is able to pursue various careers and become smarter with each rebirth. At the start, itâ€™s somewhat confusing in which life and which decade events are taking place, so I almost gave up. However, intrigued by the idea if only I continued and am satisfied to have done so, leaving me to ponder what if.
