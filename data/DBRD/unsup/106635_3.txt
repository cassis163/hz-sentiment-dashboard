I love a good retelling and I have to admit, I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper.
I wish the mystery of his identity would be solved somehow, but as he lived over a hundred years ago and was never found, I think it's save to say I'll never get an answer to that particular question :')

Audrey Rose lives in London in the 19e century, where she works as an apprentice in her uncle's laboratory, much to the dismay of her overprotected father. A coroner is not an acceptable profession for a woman in those days, especially not for a young girl.
When she discovers her family has ties to the victims killed by Leather Apron (known to us as Jack the Ripper), she sets out to find the murderer, assisted by her uncles assistant Thomas.

This book was a bit romance heavy to start of with, but after about 100-120 pages, the mystery takes center stage and I really enjoyed the story.
I did figure out the murderer fairly early, but that didn't bother me so much to be honest.

I absolutely loved Audrey Rose, she's doesn't take any crap from anybody and she doesn't let the fact that she's a woman stand in the way of her aspirations. Her flirtation with Thomas is cute, but a little cringeworthy from time to time.

Overall, this was a fun read for me.
