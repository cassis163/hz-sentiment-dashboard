Ik heb dit boek in januari 2007 in het Engels gelezen, vandaar mijn Engelse commentaar:
What a beautiful book! I've read on and on till I finished it tonight. Through the whole book you feel the loneliness of all the people involved, including Susie in her heaven. Growing up, each and every one learns the lessons of life and, gladly, there is a more or less happy ending in the book.
