Gelezen oktober 2007. Ik heb hem in het Engels gelezen (One-hit wonder), vandaar mijn reactie in het Engels:
What a lovely, delightful book. A pageturner from the beginning. A very easy read but I never thought of it as chicklit. To me it was a modern romancenovel with enjoyable characters. The only thing I had against the book was the sudden change Ana made from a shy woman with no backbone to a modern, lively and funny character. I can't imagine that a person that has been treated like Ana has by her mother and her boyfriend Hugh, can make such a sudden and glamorous change.

But, apart from that, I loved the book till the end. Very nice story, easy to read; I just couldn't stop reading.
