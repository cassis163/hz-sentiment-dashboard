I HATE THE INTERNET calls a spade a spade as it dissects the shortcomings of Western society paragraph by paragraph, delving deeper, much like the map menu on a computer before returning to the red line of Adeline’s story.

Easy to read in short blocks of text it makes you wonder how we all got it so wrong. Full of sneers it’s OMG and LOL.
