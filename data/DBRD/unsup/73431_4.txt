"It doesn't matter if you're monster or human. Living hurts."


A story about a human girl named Kate, trying to be bad and a monster boy, August, trying to be good in a world filled with actual monsters, born out of crimes commited by humans who do monstrous things.

What a gripping tale <3
The writing is absolutley beautiful and even though it took me a while to get into this world, because you're kinda left to fend for yourself when it comes to the characters, worldbuilding and the difference between all the monsters, once I did, I was captivated by the writing and the world Victoria Schwab has created.

I enjoyed this so much, finally a book about two characters, finding each other that doesn't involve a cringworthy romance.

Loved it, adored it, will be starting the second book asap!
