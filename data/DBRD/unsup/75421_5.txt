This book is a very short adaptation of the TED talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie of the same name. She talks of her experience of sexism growing up in Nigeria and how it has effected her life. It discusses why we still need feminism and why each and every person should be a feminist.

Personally, I love the eloquent way this essay is worded; it’s persuasive but doesn’t pressure you or force you into agreeing with her. It doesn’t have to because her story speaks for itself. What I think is really important is how she emphasises the way that feminism is about equality between both sexes, something which is at the core of feminism but is overlooked so often in today’s society.

This book is tiny, insightful and would make a perfect present as it also looks gorgeous. I highly recommend this to teenagers and young adults who are just being introduced to the concept on feminism, but equally anyone with an interest in the subject would also love it. It’s a great short read and one I wish every person was made to read.

By defining feminism and what it is to be a woman in the world, Adichie sends forth both comfort and a challenge. Once when I was young, my great-grandmother told me about our city before pavement, and how they were sure cars would never last because they were impractical. Had the world listened, instead of putting down pavement, we'd all still be walking or riding horses. Women today too often accept the dated definition of what it is to be female, and content themselves with walking the dirt roads when there is a better way. It requires changes. It isn't easy. It will never be easy. The day we think it is, we will have forgotten how much was given to have it.
