A heartwarming and sweet story, but it is clearly an YA-novel. It was a nice, entertaining read, and I believed the romance between the two quirky main characters who create a world of their own to escape the one they don’t understand. At the same time, this ‘real’ world is the main problem with the story. It is pictured too stereotypical to be convincible. Several sub-plots bring on serious topics, but are then left hanging, only adding drama without context. In reviews, this book is often compared to John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, but the language (conversational), characterization (one-dimensional) and emotional depth (superficial) are nowhere near this level.
