Ok, this is a hard one to rate.
3.5* feels like not enough... but 4 feels like too much...
3.75* sounds about right, but... am I really going to give out a 3/4 star???
*sigh*
Well... apparently I just did...
:')

When the spaceship Icarus (who in their right mind would call a spaceship this BTW?) crashes, Lilac LaRoux, the daugher of one of the richest man in the world and Tarver Merendsen, son of a teacher, are the only ones to make it out alive.
They crash-land on an abandoned planet and have to find a way to survive together.

This book was different from what I was expecting.
I went into this, thinking I was going to read just another YA romance novel, with a hint of sci-fi.
And even though the romance is part of the plot line, I found it wasn't the main thing.

This was a sci-fi survival story and a journey across an unknown planet.
We get to see how the relationship develops between the two main characters and I loved every minute of it.

What I didn't love, was the "twist" at the end.
When it happened, I felt it didn't fit in the story and it changed the feeling of the book. I just wasn't having it!
But, after reading what the authors did with it in the end, I have to admit, I'm ok with it.
It still wasn't my favorite part and I could've done without it, but ok... it's in there and it's fine.

I really enjoyed this book and will definitely continue with the companion novels.
