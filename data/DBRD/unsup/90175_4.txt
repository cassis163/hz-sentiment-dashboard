I awarded this 90 page adrenaline heightening voyage through the galaxy 4 stars. Mostly because of the authors ability to create a sci-fi world where culture, tradition, mathematics and biotechnology seamlessly blend in. As a reader of color it was also very refreshing to have a protagonist I could identify with for once. The best thing about this novella is that the story can be read in one sitting, not just because it's only 90 pages but once you start its really hard to stop.
