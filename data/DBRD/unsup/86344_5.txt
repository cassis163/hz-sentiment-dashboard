Alexis' and Molly's adventure goes on, and turns darker as they are forced deep into the Faery Realm.
Surrounded by the many faces of the Courts, Alexis finds her way, and her place on Keir's side. Molly has more than enough work on Dax, whose love is not what she had in mind.
Meanwhile more and more fae are missing, and they end up in a place where you'd rather not be.
