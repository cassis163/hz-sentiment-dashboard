4.5*

That was just so so good!
We follow Chaol in this book and he has always been a favorite of mine, because he is just so real, flaws and unjust feelings and all!

This story took me a while to get into, I just wasn't in the mood for it the first time I started this book, but this time... oh boy...
I read the last 350 pages in one sitting, because I just couldn't put it down!
What a wild ride and all the info we got about the main plotline... I seriously NEED the next book NOW!!!

I'm crying a little that I have to wait 6 months before I can read the conclusion of this epic tale.
