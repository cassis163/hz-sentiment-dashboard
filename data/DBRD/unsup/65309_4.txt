Although I quit at 70% this is a good book. Well written, very evocative, about an interesting period of history. It is just that, being a memoir, in each chapter a new setting with new characters is introduced which becomes a bit exhausting after a while. Reading it in your native tongue would make it easier to digest. Will continue another time.
