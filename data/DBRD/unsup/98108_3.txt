It has been years that I read a Michael Connelly detective. Used to read them each time he published a new Harry Bosch adventure. Saw this new one in the bookstore, now featuring a new detective, called Renee Ballard, who exclusively works on the night shift. I must say that I quite like this thriller, although I felt that Renee goes a bit overboard with her fanaticism. She is not a very likeable character as compared to Harry Bosch, that archtypical loner on a mission. Also, canâ€™t say that I was too interested in the minute descriptions of proper procedures and registrations in investigating crimes, but perhaps other people would find that interesting. Obviously, Michael Connelly does! It has been a while that I finished a detective so quickly and that is certainly evidence that I enjoyed the fast pace and interesting action.
