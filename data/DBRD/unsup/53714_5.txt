A story about Agnes, who is convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
She spends her last days on a little farm in Iceland and there she tells the true story behind the murders.

The writing is so beautiful, the story dark and ominous, combined with the slow way everything unfolds... I'm here for it.

Hannah Kent slowly discloses all the information leading up to the murders, and because of this slow, but very thorough development of the plot, you start to feel for every single character and you can't help but fall in love.
Not only with the characters and story, but also with Iceland :)

Absolutely captivating, if you haven't read this yet, you definitely should!
