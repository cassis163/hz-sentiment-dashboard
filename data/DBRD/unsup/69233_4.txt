So okay, where do i start. Coming from a book with difficuly vocabulary and sentence building, this was a complete change. At first i thought it was bad writing but then i realized it was just the fact that ive been reading so much sci-fi and historical fiction that i just wasn't used to some normal ya vocabs anymore. When that was out of the way, this book was AWESOME.

dinosaurs, survival, disease, what else would wienowa want in a book, I'll tell you this once but the answer is nothing.

This was the very first time i read a book in 24 hours, i started it and couldn't put it down, even read the last part on the last night of the year while my family was playing boardgames, i couldn't put it down.

I loved how the story was set up in multiple parts, it almost felt like you were reading a movie which made it 10 times more easy to visualise the events that were happening, even though some are gruesome.

I can feel myself in stormchasers character, how she sees piloria and the way she lives at home, i feel like a lot of young people would recognise themselves in her. On the other hand, lincoln, what an ass.

I immediatly picked up exile and am actually reading it right now between writing this, so I'm gonna go back to that but damn this book was a great way to end 2018. Thankyou sm wilson, please continue writing stories like this.
