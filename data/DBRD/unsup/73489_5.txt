Wow, this was totally different from what I was expecting!
First, I thought it was YA, untill I read a specific scene that made it pretty clear it's a NA :)

The story gripped me, I absolutely loved the characters. They were well written and the story had a lot of depth to it. Not the fluffy, YA read I was expecting at all and that made me love it even more.

We follow a dual perspective of Ryen (a girl) and Misha (a boy), who have been writing letters since the 5th grade, agreing to never meet, talk or do anything other than write letters to eachother. They become best friends, untill Misha stops writing...

What I loved the most, was that Ryen was deeply flawed and I got to follow her, trying to figure out why Misha stopped writing, all in the middle of the process of getting to know herself and ultimately finding out what she finds important in life.
