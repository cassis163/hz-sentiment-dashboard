This is the use of technology to the limits, over the limits. Mae starts working for the Circle a technology company that uses social media extremely. All employees have 3 to 8 screens where they have to keep in contact with other colleagues, customers, answer all kind of questions, post everything about their life, pictures, hobbies, you name it. There is no privacy, having secrets is stealing.

Mae starts wearing a realtime camera and mic so that everyone sees what she sees and hears what she says. She wears a special wristband that collects all kind of information about her health, that information is also streamed to the whole world.

Some ideas of the Circle sound great, but some are way too far if you would start using them in your own life. This book starts where 1984 ended. Big Brother is watching and hearing you.
