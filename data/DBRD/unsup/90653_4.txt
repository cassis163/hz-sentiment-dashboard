Miracle at the Higher Grounds Cafe
''Each star, numbered. Each star, named! Like every grain of sand. Every hair on his head. Every trouble that filled his day. Created. Numbered. Known.''
sorry that this is English guys!

First of all I really liked this book! I'm not into believing in god. I'm not an atheist but I'm not an theist. I don't know if god is real there is no evidence but there is no evidence that god doesn't exist. So I'm an agnost. And I can live with that.

I read it in Dutch. There it's called Cafe Wonder. That title is easier if I'm fair. I'm not into believing. The god I see is Morgan Freeman because of all those movies. But I was interested in this book. I don't know why but it looked so nice and reading is fun. It isn't what I usually read so it was very nice to read.

I liked the way Max wrote this book. I read this book in a few days and it's so nice. I really like the story line. It's not the most original but it is a good one so it's far. Also I don't read much from male writers so that's also a change that I have experienced. And I have to say I like it. I like this book so that's good news!

I love the way Chelsea wants to give the caf√© new life. I think it's wonderful if you do something like that for your family. I like the story line. With Chelsea and her ex and their children. I usually read about younger people so it's nice for a change to see the few of older people.

The idea of sending a message to god is so nice. Good job Max! I think it's makes this story so interesting. The way to "speak" with god, I think it's so original. Very lovely to read.

I really think this is a great story. I like the character. I like the story line. I just like the way it's written. It's a great book that I recommend! Even though I don't know if god is real. In this book god is real. And god is a very nice man to help Chelsea. And if you exist god I hope that you are just as nice as in this book
