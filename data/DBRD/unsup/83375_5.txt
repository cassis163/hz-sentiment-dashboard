Tales of Beedle the Brard. A short book of story for wizard children. Hermione get this book after the death of Dumbledore, in the fight against Voldemort. The book is easy to read and is a really book that every Harry Potter fans must have in their bookcase.

There is not much to say about this book, it's like I said before little stories that were read to children wizards.
