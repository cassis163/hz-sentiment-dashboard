This book has a lot of emotions, because this is the end of the Harry Potter series. The truth emerges and everything you do can be the last. When I read this book, and especially the middle to the end, you feel the stirring of the tears that you can not stop in a hurry. J.K. has written a book full of emotions you just can not let go. Of course it's only a book, but the meanings and anything hold you anyway. Every Potterhead (fans) understand this.
