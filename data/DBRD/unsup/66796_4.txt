"4.5 stars!"

aaaah, i need Scarlet now!!! This was such a lovely book!
I liked it so much and i really want to know how it continues.

Cinder is just a really lovely retelling of Cinderella. The basic storyline was there but it was twisted into something modern and really interesting.

I thought the beginning was pretty slow. But the ending... Wow! It ended so strong and i really really want to read Scarlet immediately
