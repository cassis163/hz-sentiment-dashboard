This book was an adrenaline fueled trip and hard to put down. Stephen King's characters, brought to life by realistic dialogue and quirky manerisms really get under your skin and some of them even seep into your heart. Even though this is not one of his signature horror stories, getting a glimpse into the innerworkings of a deranged killer will definitely give you the creeps from time to time. After finishing this book I don't know if I have to admire or give Stephen King a freaking side eye for being able to write disturbing events so authentically. Disturbing is of course putting it very mildly.

All that being said I will definitely finish this trilogy!! I'm familiar with a great many of Stephen King's book to movie adaptations (which in my opinion mostly suck), but this is the 1st time I have actually finished one of his books.... and I am freaking hooked!! Let's just say that I get why attempts to bring his writing to the screen are so frequently made.

The Mr Mercedes tv series will air from the 9 August 2017 and I hope they get it right this time.
