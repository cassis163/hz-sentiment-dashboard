4.5*

This book...
I just finished it and I'm going to need a minute...

It's hard to describe this story, without giving away to much. I think it's better going in not knowing to much, so I will leave it at this short synopsis:
The story starts in present time (I think). The military is doing experiments on death row inmates, that have been given the choice to participate in this project or remain in prison (and thus dying).

Amy is a young girl, who, at the age of 6 has been left at a convent by her mother.
Somehow, this girls is connected to the experiments.

After the experiment goes horribly wrong, the world blows up and in the near future, a small group sets out to find answers and, hopefully, set the world right again.

I LOVED this book!
It's big and it's definitely not a fast read, because you get a lot of information, especially in the beginning of the book, but it's well worth it!
The characters drew me in and the plot was, to my surprise, fairly fast paced.

There's a lot going on to keep you interested and wanting more.
The ending though... it made me want to pick up the second book in this series straight away.
I can't wait to see how this epic tale ends :D

I feel like I'm not doing this book justice, at all!
Let me just say, that if you like an epic dystopian, set in the near future, with well written characters, a story line that will keep you guessing and you love the supernatural made reality: this is the book for you!
