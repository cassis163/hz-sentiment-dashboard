That cliff-hanger!
The third book in what I can easily say is one of the best series I've ever read!
As soon as I started this book, I was drawn in. It has a new HP, Elise!
It is hard to write a review without spoiling anything.
The best thing in this series is the worldbuilding, the multi-layered stories and characters, the fact that I didn't want to finish the books.

Must read!

Longing for book 4!
