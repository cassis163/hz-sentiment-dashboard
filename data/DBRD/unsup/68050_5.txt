Kate has left Verity and tries to forget all that has happened by hunting and killing monsters.
August has joined the FTF and has his own team of monsterhunters.

They haven't spoken in 6 months, but when a new kind of monster appears, their paths cross again.

I loved This Savage Song, but Our Dark Duet was even better.
The characters are... more mature and my love for August has only grown.
He has this dark edge to him in this book and Victoria Schwab does an excellent job of toeing the line between good and evil.
This story makes you feel and think, about good and evil and the incredibly large gray area in between.
