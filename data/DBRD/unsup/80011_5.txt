I heard so many people talk about this book and even though I'm not the biggest contemporary YA reader, I picked this up, because the story sounded good and I wanted to know if it was any good.

I love, love, LOVED this!
The story follows Simon, a 17 year old boy who is still in the closet, but has an online love affair with a boy called Blue.
They go to the same school, but don't know each others real identity.

Unfortunately, someone reads the emails they send and starts blackmailing Simon.

This is a coming of age story and I couldn't put it down!
The writing style is so incredibly funny and the story gave me all the feels! I laughed, wanted to cry and felt for each and every character.
It's a quick read and perfect for the summer, if you haven't picked it up yet: get it now!
