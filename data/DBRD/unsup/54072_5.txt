It's way passed my bedtime, but I was so close to finishing the book that I didn't want to put it away before I had done so. Normally I try to write a coherent review, but I'm not sure if I'll find the right words to do so this time.

When I first discovered A Court of Thorns and Roses I was fascinated and when I won the first book I was even more happy, but after the first half of the book I was slightly disappointed. I remember telling others that I could imagine others liking it, but that I didn't. And then there was that wonderful moment, that wonderful moment that Rhysand appeared and things started to change. Where I had been complaining about the chemistry between Tamlin and Feyre, I could feel it with Rhysand. I am not a shipper, but I became one, for them. It was as if in that moment my mating bond with these books snapped finally into place.

I was not disappointed in the second book and after finishing A Court of Mist and Fury I was waiting for the last book to arrive. I pre-ordered it on Ibooks and I was lucky that my day off was timed perfectly. I spent the entire day reading. Curled up in my chair, lured into the story from start to finish.

Sarah J. Maas has the talent to craft those words and scenes into such a beautiful scenery. With only a few small sentences she can make a character or place come to life, she can add depth and background. From start to finish I enjoyed the twists and turns, the new characters, the well known and beloved characters we got to know even better, more twists and turns, a few surprises and some amazing well crafted and well prepared scenes.

As someone who aspires to become a writer one day, I can only hope that I'll ever manage to write a book half as good as this one. And I can't wait to read the other stories set in Prythian!
