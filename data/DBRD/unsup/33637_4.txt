Wonderful debut by Jeffrey Debris. I enjoyed this book from start to finish.
Even though the book contains a lot of characters and they are introduced in a rapid succession, it was easy to follow and remember. In my opinion, the characters need a bit more depth, but perhaps we will get to know them better in the follow-up novel. I am really looking forward to Debris's next book!
