This was my first, official, buddy read and it was such a lot of fun!
Thanks Yv, for a great reading experience :)

This is a hard one for me to rate...
I did really enjoy this book and the story. The writing style was really good, I liked all the characters and it was well constructed. I do think the victim, Simon, deserved a little more background though.

I could predict all the secrets and even though the ending was a surprise for me, it felt a little forced.

So why did I have a hard time rating this?
I feel I might be judging this a little too harsh, because I'm comparing it to all the adult thrillers I've read and I keep forgetting this is a YA and not an adult book.
But still, this didn't feel like a thriller to me, it focused too much on the secrets and was more of a Gossip Girl kind of book.

Not a bad book, not at all, I enjoyed it a lot, just not quite what I was expecting.
