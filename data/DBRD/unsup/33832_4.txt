Maybe not the best, but worth trying. Great work from this writer to have a novel which moves the sight of the writer from one to another view of personages. Not what everybody expects, not a whodonit, but a roman writen from different perspectives, it reads like a running train. Innovate, new, well written, investigating, interesting and a lovely read. I donâ€™t mind Walker is not Walker, Margot is not Margot,I loved the story from beginning to the end! Would read it again!
