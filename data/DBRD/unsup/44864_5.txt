Is so well-designed book, I went to see the movie. Personally, I really like disasters, to watch a movie.

The 5th Wave starts out pretty strange, I think, it was difficult. But also in the book fit all the pieces together and it was a wonderful book to read, so I decided to read it again. When Cassie would save her brother from the aliens, they do not know who they can trust and who does. All parents are killed leaving only the kids. Best horrific when you read it that way.

Furthermore, the story reads very fine, fine font and plotting good constructive. Personally, I do not know if here in a movie or book comes out, but I'm very curious to.
