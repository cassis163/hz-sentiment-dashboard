Exactly one year ago, I was in the International Film Festival in Rotterdam to see the film of #WhitStillman: Love and Friendship. And there we were at 9.15 in the morning to see this wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's novella "Lady Susan" and afterwards Whit Stillman and Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett (what a name!!) were there too. I love the film immensely and I have seen it twice.
And Whit Stillman also wrote a book. If you think that will be a normal screenplay, that is not the case. The book is written from the viewpoint of Rufus, the nephew of Sir James. He thinks that the spinster authoress has made fun of his uncle, who is a lovely, joyful, but often named a fool. In this book Rufus retells the story of Jane Austen and gives comments to how his uncle was and therefore also how his new aunt (Lady Susan) in the end was. What a ltierary find is that! it could be from Jane herself!
It is a lovely story, with lots of wit and mild humour and a warmth that is making this cold day nice. Whit Stillman did a very fine thing here and I love it to bits.
And you know: there was a questionaire on the Dutch Jane Austen site, with which man you wanted to go on: Sir James Martin, Manwaring or Reginald. And yes, most women wanted Sir James Martin. Such a delight and sunshine to have him around!!
