THE FIFTH SEASON

The structure, the POV's, the characters, the world building, the way systemic oppression is interwoven into this fantasy narrative .... makes this book one you will either hate or fall madly in love with.

With this book I really needed to savour and digest everything that was revealed within those chapters about Damaya, Syenite and Essun ... to have my mind blown towards the end

Since I've just finished the first installment, that sort of left my heart in ruin ... I've decided that I need some time to properly recuperate before I pick up the sequel. So far this was a truly magnificent reading experience.
