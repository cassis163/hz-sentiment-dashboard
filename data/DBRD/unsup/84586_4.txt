How strange it is to be posting a review of The Circle on a social media forum. I want to give it a 4.5 rating. It's not a 5 because the main character, Mae, is too endearing, too one-dimensional to be convincing. Despite that, Dave Eggers has written a consistently entertaining and disturbingly recognizable story. “You know how you finish a bag of chips and you hate yourself? You know you’ve done nothing good for yourself. That’s the same feeling, and you know it is, after some digital binge. You feel wasted and hollow and diminished.” After reading this book I felt completely the opposite. Definitely worth a read
