4,5 stars. This book really made an impression on me. It's very original, both the story as the main character, and despite not really knowing much about autism/Asperger, the story is told in such a way that I understood the character's perspective and reasoning. As a reader you really start to care for Christopher, especially once he starts making his brave journey. It was very interesting to see "our" world from Christopher's perspective and I loved how the story developed.
