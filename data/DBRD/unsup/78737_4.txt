3,5 stars. I reread this book recently and I thought it was a sad, but beautifully written story. However, I think that due to not living in the USA (/ever having lived there), I lack a bit of "culture knowledge" about the USA that is needed to fully grasp this story and all its nuances. I still understood the main message/feelings, but I'm pretty sure for someone who knows the USA better than I do, there's even more to the story.
