I got this book free on a website an am pleasantly surprised with the quality of this story. I really enjoyed this legal thriller and will certainly read the sequells as this is part of a series. The main characters are certainly not the 'politically correct' welldoers met in many other novels but they are credible people. The only comment I have to make is that in the e-book I read, chapter 39 belongs a few chapters back in the chronology of the story. As to where it stands now, it doesn't make any sense. I like to know if the same mistake is made in the written books?
