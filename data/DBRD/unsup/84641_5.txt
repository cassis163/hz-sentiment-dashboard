I absolutely loved this 4th volume in the Erika Foster series.
They keep getting more gripping and gruesome and this was a real nailbiting and unputdownable thriller.

While gradually becoming more respectful towards her colleagues and environment, Erika is still snapping at them, and rebelious against her supervisors but her strong-mindedness is an asset to the story and her strong will and commitment plays in her favor when persuing a case towards its resolution.

The case is such a complex one, the murders so cruel, and the perpetrator so hard to capture, that in this volume, less focus is placed on the private lives of Erika and her colleagues. But that's ok as we already are familiar with that aspect and they did not have time for anything else but chasing the perpetrator anyway.

While the police force does not have any clue yet, quite early in the story the reader already gets a glimpse of the perpetrator and gradually the motives for his cruel crimes are shared.
This is one of the reasons to me, why this is a perfect story as it approaches the facts from different perspectives.

As this is a contemporary story, using modern technology to solve a case, an important message is given to always be vigilant when using the internet, particularly facebook, and other social media and to always consider the possible consequences when spreading information on the internet.

I was fully absorbed by this captivating thriller. One of the best books I have read this year. Great job, Mr. Bryndza! Keep on writing many more of these gripping thrillers.
