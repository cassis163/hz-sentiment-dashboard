The girl who drank the moon is a fairytale that is beautifully written. That being said ... the writing often feels more like reading magical realism than the whimisical middle grade fantasy itâ€™s supposed to be. What I enjoyed most was the description of magic ... it has a smell, a flavor, a color and at times even texture... the plot is a teensy weensy bit dark but will keep you turning pages till the end. Will also be available in Dutch from 25th of April 2018
