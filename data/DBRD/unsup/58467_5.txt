This Is Where I Left You is FUNNY. Slidesplitting, chortle out loud, belly-aching funny. And the reason is because Jonathan Tropper has so genuinely captured the dynamics of a dysfunctional family that still maintains its love for each other...even if they can't stand to be together.
This is a totally irreverent book -- not for those who feel the least uptight about religion or sex, or hold traditional views of family. There are absolutely hilarious scenes: one of the siblings and his wife making love as their activities are inadvertently broadcast to the shocked older shiva attendees below. The "inappropriately self-absorbed shiva caller" award. Potty training gone awry. It's all interspersed with truly poignant moments of a family who clumsily works out those issues that every family seems to have.
The honesty of Tropper's writing is not only refreshing, but completely breathtaking at some points. He says, through the narration of Judd, all of those little thoughts that run through our mind when life is happening that we would rather not acknowledge. This thoughts that make us seem selfish, petty, and cold-hearted. That, if actually said out loud while we were thinking them, would make the people around us hate us and our callousness. But it's just so damn honest.

I loved loved this book. This is my first book by Tropper and it will definitely not be the last. His character development is spot on and entertaining without getting boring while learning about each person...The way Tropper writers, you just want to keep reading, and turning, and reading...it is one of those books that makes you sad to put down.
The story itself is very emotional and I found myself crying (and laughing!) often...anyone can relate to love loss - physically and emotionally.
