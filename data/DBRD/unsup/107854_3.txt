Reading this book has been a strange sensation. From the moment I started this book, the use of present tense (not this tense in general, but its use of it) annoyed me. (The translation could have been a factor in this, I have not checked it with its original.) Also, some parts were too much thoughtlike for my taste. It denied me the pleasure to read without caring for those technicalities. Despite all that, The Fifth Wave fascinated me and the story urged me to keep reading. A sort of love-hate relationship, if you will.
