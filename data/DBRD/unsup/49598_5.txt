This second book of Jennifer Worth tells about her work as a district nurse (more than a midwife as in the first book). She tells about people, who have forced to live in the Workhouse in the fifties and those stories are really heartbreaking and moving. She has (had) a way of writing that makes you want to read more and more. It is a beautiful lagacy she have left ot us.
