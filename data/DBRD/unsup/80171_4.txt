This book was a fast read. To me it felt more like a movie script then a play. Seemed to ambitious to be a play. Overall it seems a great addition to the series. The story was very enjoyable, but I do have some reservations towards the end regarding the devices and where they are found. It seemed a bit to convenient although very logical. Most of the book felt more like a fanfic then a actual Rowling book. It does however deserve the respect overall for being a pleasant read and it certainly opens doors to future HP book series. Now let's all hope Rowling gets inspired by the muses and starts writing on her next Masterpiece.
