I hate cheesy romance novels but I loved "Me Before You". Hated getting to the end and cried buckets (totally not me) but JoJo Moyes writes so sincerely that you just know that this story could have been true. I was so happy that she wrote this sequel. Who didn't love Lou and her crazy family? Her wonderful heart? Read it on a rainy day with a box of Kleenex. It closes the loop on Will Traynor and you will not be disappointed.....


Moyes is such a gifted writer. You definitely want to read Me Before You before you read this one, since After You is a sequel to that. Also, you’ll want to read Me Before You before you read the rest of my review, since I’m about to give away the ending to that book.

You have been warned.

After You begins with Louisa still in mourning eighteen months after the death of Will, a man she loved dearly. She works at a horrible job and attends a group to deal with loss, but it takes meeting Lily and paramedic Sam and several trials and tribulations with their lives, her family member’s lives, and her own life to begin to move Louisa forward. This book, like Me Before You, has romantic elements, but unlike some romance novels, you definitely can’t figure out how the hero and heroine’s story will conclude—how they will overcome obstacles and either get together or not—until the very end.

Though this deals with the difficult topic of grief and loss, like Moyes’ other books, there are several humorous, chuckle-inducing moments as well as parts of the book that brought tears to my eyes. I couldn’t more highly recommend this book.

I reasd the english version -After You (Me Before You #2)
