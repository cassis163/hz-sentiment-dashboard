Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed reading this book. Itâ€™s a brilliant story with memorable characters, both entertaining and dramatic. The beginning is incredibly strong and the suspense is well maintained throughout the novel. The various narratives flow seamlessly into each other and I just wanted to keep paging through it. The Goldfinch is powerfully evocative; I heard the NY noises, felt the heat of the desert, smelled the antique shop and loved it all.
