A mother abandons her two children. As a result they have to make mature decisions, have a hard time fitting in with their peers and become assaulted by adults. This novel could have easily turned into a sentimental tearjerker. But, thanks to Walls’s writing skills, the opposite is true. The tone is down-to-earth and straightforward. There’s a whole range of wonderful characters, but to my disappointment most of them remain quite flat throughout the story. The ending is also a bit too easy and implausible, which is why I give this book 3,5 stars instead of 4.
Conclusion: I would recommend this as a YA novel. Even though this book deals with harsh themes and has its flaws, it’s a lovely story. I’m eager to read Walls’ memoir, The Glass Castle.
