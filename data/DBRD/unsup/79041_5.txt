Impression -
While I seize the table by transforming it with all kinds of bits and pieces into a major disaster area I try to unwind my brains getting rid of thoughts like ‘perfection’ or ‘total failure’ and just get started, keep going and enjoy creating a collage. D’Aquino knows how to do this, you just follow her thoughts and ideas on this in her book. She keeps the perfect balance between inspirational examples and text, easy to pick up every moment you need a little push. I loved it!

Quote -“For me, a piece of paper is like a stage. I think that’s why I like to cut up shapes, colour, and characters. I can move the pieces around on top of it and simply watch what unexpected interactions happen. Sometimes, it really is as simple as that.”
