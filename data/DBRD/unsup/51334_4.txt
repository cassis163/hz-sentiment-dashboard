I actually did enjoy this book. It may not be great literature but the story is entertaining, fast-paced and even funny in certain places. Certainly good enough to read the next volume (I got the first 3 books for free from bookbub so check it out!) The major criticism is that the characters despite being likeable are a bit too stereotypical for fantasy-heroes, neither Zirkander nor Sardelle (names could better as well) seems to have any flaws and they fall for each other almost at first sight.
