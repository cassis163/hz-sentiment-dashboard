A story about real people, real life, action and reaction. On how we all have our own stories, which sometimes prevent us from seeing what's actually happening and on how to see miracles in the ordinary. But I also feel the book remains a bit superficial and - if you've read a lot - the 'big revelation' doesn't come as a surprise. A typical book where the reader will add his or her own colour, according to their life's experiences and views: some will have their minds blown, others are utterly unimpressed and I myself remain somewhere inbetween.
