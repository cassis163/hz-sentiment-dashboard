This book... it was AWESOME!
I took my time picking this up, because I thought the format wasn't going to be for me and even though it took me a little longer than usual to get in to, I ended up loving it!
Illuminae totally surprised me, I love it when that happens :)

We follow Kady. On the day that she breaks up with her boyfriend Ezra, her planet is attacked and everybody who survives this attack flees on 3 starships, trying to outrun the enemy ship.

The book was a bit slow to start, it only really picked up half way through the book, but at that point it had its hooks in me and didn't let go! The build up was fantastic in this book though. You start of a little confused and I had some issues with certain plotpoints not being given enough attention, but it all makes sence at the end. The last half of the book was a lot of fast-paced action and that's where I got really sucked in the story.

The reason I'm not giving this book the full 5 stars, is that I found Ezra to be a little shallow and I just didn't really like him, I certainly didn't see why Kady would risk everything, just for him.
But my issues are just minor points and I can't wait to read Gemina!
