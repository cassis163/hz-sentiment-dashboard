A warning: this book is not for readers who only like books in which the story goes from A to B.

Timewise this book is all over the place. It is also more a collection of chapters than a coherent book. It is a book about the U.S punk scene in the late 70s, the same people in the 90s and their kids in a near future, but it moves through time like time doesn't exist. By reading you find out who the protagonist of the chapter is and where you are in time. Each chapter has a different protagonist.

It is a daring book. It is interesting. It is entertaining. But.......... I didn't feel a connection with any of the protagonists. I constantly felt that I was an onlooker, watching the stories from the sideline. It was an interesting read and three stars means: liked it, and I did, but not enough to give it more than 3 stars.
