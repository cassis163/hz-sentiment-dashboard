This book took some time to get used to. Because of the Dutch setting, names and words, it felt like I was reading an English translation of a Dutch book at first. But after a few pages, the mystery drew me in and didn’t let me go. I loved the author’s very unique style. Although the story was far from realistic, the peculiar, multi-layered and secretive characters made it worth the read. I was intrigued by the atmosphere and was compelled to binge-read until the end. After finishing the book, I immediately read the first chapter again and it all made sense. Finally, I could turn off the light and get some sleep. Conclusion: very good, especially for a debut novel.
