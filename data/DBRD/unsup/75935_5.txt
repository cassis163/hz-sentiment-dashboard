I have red the story in Dutch. One of the best stories I read the last few years. It is a beautifull story about a boy without shadow who fell in love with a boy of glass. It is about freedom, it is about acceptation, but the story is especially about love.
This is de best story I have red so far of Thomas. I recommend this story to all my friends, because the story is beyond all frontiers. It is well written and gives you a inside in persons emotions.
