A retelling of the Trojan war, the Iliad, Ancient Greece, o baby, count me in! Please give me this story!
(And #Netgalley did!)

War is a thing for men, thought about of by men, started by men, done by men, fought by men, lost
by men. But still women are the ones who men fight about and the ones who lose the most.

First of all, look at the cover, it grabbed my attention immediately because it is stunning and so telling what you will be finding inside.
The short description though is what grabbed me and pulled me over the line to sent in my request.

The vivid way of describing the surroundings and happenings makes it seem as if you are right there next to Briseis.
You get to live the darkest period of her life beside her. But you also get to see how she loses everything including her
freedom to how she tries to overcome that dreading fact and tries to find herself again.

I was delighted when I saw that my request to review an early copy for this book was accepted! Once again, thank you so much Netgalley and author Pat Barker.

Story: 5/5
Characters: 4,5/5 Loved Briseis, loved Achilles slightly less.
Writing: 4,5/5 The sudden switch between characters about halfway, was slightly confusing for a moment.
