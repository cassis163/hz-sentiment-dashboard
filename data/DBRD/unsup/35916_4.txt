This was so good I couldn't stop reading. Although I had a feeling who the bad guy was, the end was still a surprise (but my hunge was good). It's always the dark secrets that come back to haunt you and to keep them covered, more and more murders are necessary. I read several books of Erica Spindler now and I'm hooked, she is a new favorite writer for me.
