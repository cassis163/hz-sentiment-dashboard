“You’re nobody's doorway but your own, and the only one who gets to tell you how your story ends is you."

This 169 page novel has characters that are diverse in a Mrs. Peregrine's home for peculiar children kind of way, it reads a bit like a modern fairy tale before it turns into a thriller with some dark elements that border on horror. Underneath all of that Seanan McGuire manages to interweave very comical dialogue, some psychological truths and herewith create a very enjoyable read.

The story is as whimsical as it is weird and at times dark with at the heart some powerful messages about otherness, belonging and being in charge of your own destiny ...
