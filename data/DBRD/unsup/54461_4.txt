John Edgar Hoover, what an intriging person. He hated communists, jews, blacks, indians, gays althought he was gay himself. Never would a black person, indian, jew or woman become the president of the USA. All the big names of the american history make an entrance in this book. He also had something against the Kennedys. Have to say that the image we all have of JFK and his wife is not what it was like. He had a lot of affairs, with Marilyn Monroe to name one. And she died in strange circumstances. She is not the only one that died in suspicious circumstances. I've read this book in one day, so intriging was it. Hard to believe he has been so important behind the screens.
