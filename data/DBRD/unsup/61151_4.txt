Zélie was destined to be a Maji, a person with magic, but everything changed the night magic was cut down by The King and every maji right along with it, including Zélie's mother.

Now Zélie is all grown up and she is determined to bring magic back!

I loved the world this story is set in. Not only the landscape I could totally see when I closed my eyes, but the magic system was so intricate and detailed. Loved it!
And I kinda want my very own snow leoponaire...

Zélie develops into a strong and powerful protagonist and I absolutely adored Amari, she grows so much during the course of this book and I can't wait to see how she evolves in the rest of the series. I have no doubt she'll kick major ass :D

Inan though... I liked him, but didn't love him.
He felt a teeny tiny bit flat and although the love to hate trope is my absolute favorite, this romance felt a little rushed and not quite believable.

I absolutely loved all the events taking place at the end of this book and I can not wait for the next book, but... I do wish it had taken a bit more time, explored everything that went down a little more (even though that would make this already big book even bigger, I still feel it was a little rushed) so I could have taken it all in even better. I feel I would have felt all the emotions more.

This was such a great first installment in a series from a debut author, I can only imagine what she's going to do with the next book.
I for one am completely excited and I would pre-order the second book if I could!
