Interesting person and personality. As with most 'great' people difficult to live with or work with. I didn't know he was that much involved in the ending of WW II. The Americans with Roosevelt wanted to land in Normandie in 1943, but it became juni 1945 until it was so far. Churchill had a lot of arguments to wait, wonder if he has prolonged the war or if his objecting was right and what would have happened if D-day was in 1943. Would America and the Alliance have won or not, we will never know.
