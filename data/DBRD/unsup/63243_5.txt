What a marvellous writer Jane Gardam is! ‘The Man in the Wooden Hat’ is the 2nd novel in the Old Filth trilogy, telling the story from his wife Betty’s perspective. The quiet desperation of Betty’s voice was at times hard to bear for me, yet at the same time she expresses a love of life that never diminishes. I can’t express how very sensitve and moving Jane Gardam told her side of the story. Highly recommended!
