The tears came just as sudden as the ending.
While I was learning about the though job that being a doctor is, I also learned about literature, about someone's curiosity and than the sudden end.
I do not think I would survive a diagnosis like that, I would not be as strong as Paul is.
This ending. All of the sudden it was just done and the shock gave me tears. I knew I was going to cry,
but this book is everything but a clich√©. It's well written and gave me new insights. Thank you for this book. I think it's just what I needed at the moment.
