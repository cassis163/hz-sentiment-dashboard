This book's plot is very well thought of. Obviously, Kristin Cashore is a writer who knows what not only writing, but also plotting a story is. Little details from the beginning of the book, seemingly irrelevant for the story, will later on be connected by dots you didn't even know of yet. That's what makes this story strong. That and the depth of the characters. No person is one thing: the main character learns - and with it the reader - that everyone is somewhere in between the range of good and bad. Cashore made sure that most of her characters have their own flaws, which makes them only more relatable.

I can recommend this story to every one of you who likes the thrill of suspence, of taking a journey into the not so black-and-white world of people with somewhat fantastical gifts (but who are nonetheless very human) and of emotions that tug at your heart.
