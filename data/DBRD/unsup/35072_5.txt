Saterday night I’ve read the book Stormwind of Jackie van Laren. Again this is a five star book in the Island series. This book is a bit more serious than the first but I could really appreciate the strong and authentic characters in the book, they made the story feel very familiar again! Can’t wait to read the third part of the series! This already is my favorite series of 2019!
