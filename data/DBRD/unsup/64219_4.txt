I read this book as an E-book and I absolutely loved it! I flew through the pages and before I knew the story ended. Leaving me longing for more, I’m very curious how the story will go on and I can’t wait for mister Ference’s next novel.

The book is divided in twenty-two chapters which encourages the natural flow in reading pauses. For me an absolute plus cause otherwise I would have read it all at ones without taking a break.
The story itself reads like an old tale, feels like a good fantasy novel. So here and there it meets other/older stories and shows I have read and seen on television. But I absolute don’t mind. It still is a standalone story which I enjoyed reading.

The author created a story which shows his talent for creating a world. Throughout the story you can imagine the surroundings well and feel with the characters, their struggles and search for love. Also the use of language compliments the story, for me it comes across as a sort of old English. This fits the story perfectly cause it’s set in the late 1800’s in England.

This story has it all, from excitement, horror, to romance and love. If you like to read a wonderful scary fantasy story this is an absolute must read!
