Griffin just lost his first love and ex-boyfriend, Theo, in a drowning accident.
He is heartbroken and the only person who truly understands his grief, is Theo's new boyfriend Jackson.
Together, they try to deal with their pain and somehow move forward.

I have no words for how much I truly loved this book... I laughed, I cried, I felt compassion, sorrow, grief, anger... the entire emotional spectrum came in to play while reading this little book and I am here for it!
I finished it last night and I am a wreck, in the best possible way!

Apparently I'm reading Adam Silvera's books backwards, as I started with They both die at the end, followed by History and am now impatiently awaiting More happy than not to arrive on my doorstep.
Even though his next few books don't have titles (or definite release dates) yet, you better believe I will be reading them as soon as they come out!

All the stars *\o/*
