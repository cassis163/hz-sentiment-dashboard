This book sure shows a different side of Steve Jobs. He is not what we think he is, the guy that jumps on a podium to show the latest ixxx. It must have been extremely difficult to work together with this egocentric, narcistic genius that wanted perfection in all details, and even then it wasn't good enough. I guess it was also for himself difficult to live with himself. This biography is a page turner with a lot of well known persons in it who made computers, hardware, software, design what they are now.
