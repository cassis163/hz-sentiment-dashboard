I love a good thriller or spooky read in the Fall, the creepier, the better and in that regard, this book was just what I wanted... so good!

While this was definitely not horror and The Bone Collector has nothing on Hannibal Lecter, it was a really suspenseful thriller.

The story centres around a serial killer, The Bone Collector, who has abducted a little girl with cleft hands. This leads to a cat-and-mouse game between The Collector, Etta Fitzroy (the detective on the case) and Erdman Frith, the father of a boy with Stone Man disease.

This book kept me wanting more. I just couldn't put it down (but since I buddy read it, I had to :') ). The story was filled with twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat and although I did find a lot of the twists a little predictable, I devoured this book and I can't wait for the next one!
