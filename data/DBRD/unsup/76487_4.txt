The Good Girls is the sequel to The Perfectionists. In Beacon Heights everyone is perfect, but five perfect girls have done some pretty ugly things. Ava, Caitlin, Julie, Mackenzie and Parker pulled a prank on Nolan and now he is dead. He is been murdered and the girls are being framed for his dead. In their film studies class they made a list who deserves to die, isn't it strange that Nolan Hotchkiss died exactly how they described it? It gets weirder when the next person on their list dies. Is it coincidence or is there more to the story?

The book started a little slow-paced, it took some time to get into it. But when things got started, it really started. You get to know the main characters in such a deep way. It really makes it seem like you are part of a very close friend group. The girls all get their own moments to shine. The book reads easily and is a real page turner when the drama starts. Even the parts where there isn't really anything happening are so well written that you fly right passed them. The only issue that I have with this book is the last chapter. That ruined the plot. That shouldn't be part of the story.
