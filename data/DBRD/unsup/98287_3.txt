Wow, it's over a year ago that I started reading this book, but I can finally say I've finished reading it. It didn't take me so long, because the book wasn't good... First there were just other books that I had to read (because I had to finish reading those before a certain date) and then I sort of "forgot" I was reading this book... But a few weeks ago I "found" it again and started again from the first chapter. And I'm glad I did, because I did really enjoy this book for the most part. However, some parts of it I didn't find very interesting, and I was a bit surprised by the ending, although it was nice it didn't all end in misery. But I think my expectations for this book were a bit too high, and so although I did enjoy it, I didn't love it.
