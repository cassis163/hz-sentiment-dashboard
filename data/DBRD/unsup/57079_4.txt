A book all about my favorite nerd??? Yes, please!

This is a collection of novella's about Simon's road to becoming a Shadowhunter.
All the much loved characters from TMI make an appearance, although I would have liked a little bit more Maia.

Simon has always been one of my favorite characters and I really enjoyed reading how he becomes a Shadowhunter and deals with his memories being taken.
I flew through this and I think it gives you a lot of information, before starting Lady Midnight.
