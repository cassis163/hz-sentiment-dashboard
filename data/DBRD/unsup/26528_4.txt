3.5*

How can an ending still suprise you and make you feel sad, when the title of the book is litteraly giving away what will happen???

In a world where there is a service that lets you know when your death day will be, two boys, Mateo and Rufus get that death call and decide to make the most of their last they. They join the Last Friend app and get in touch. We get to follow along on their end day and enjoy the development of their friendship.

I really enjoyed this book, even though I was a little hessitant to pick it up.
A friend of mine, who's opinion I really trust, didn't enjoy this book, so I was expecting not to like it much to be honest.

The story of Mateo and Rufus was so simple, just two guys, trying to live their live as best they can, while trying to help each other come to terms with the fact neither of them will be around much longer.
Almost every review I read, talks about Mateo, but for me, Rufus is the one that makes this book. He's outgoing, funny, loving and makes every body around him, including Mateo, come alive.

I loved their story so much, that the other POV's felt totally unnecessary, a bit disruptive and actually took away from the impact of the main plotline.
Shame, because without those bits, this would have been a solid 4, maybe even a 4.5* book for me...
