The first book of Harry Potter.

When I saw the movie on TV, when I was young. I started to read the Harry Potter books. First in Dutch version, later in English and now in German.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher stone was in the beginning, my favorite book. When the other comes it was difficult to choose, I might just have one favorite. And now years later, is all the movie are favorite and I haven't to choose it.

Harry Potter the boy who lived. Live with his aunt, uncle and cousin in a quiet neighborhood. One day, Harry gets a letter that he was admitted to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. In his first year he stands face to face with the most feared wizard in their world and will Harry defeat him to save the Philosopher's Stone.

The first good book in the series.
And I read and read and read it every time again.
