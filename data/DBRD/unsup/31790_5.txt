Very interesting book. If you have read In Europ and liked that one, you will certainly like this one too. The author is making the same trip as John Steinbeck, Nobel Price Winner, did in 1960. Steinbeck travelled with his dog Charlie, Geert Mak travels with his wife.
In 1960, America was at some turning point, just as it is now. If you read the book, you will better understand the way americans think and why they vote the way they do. This book shows small villages after the economic and banking crisis, how the youth of the villages is moving away because there is no future in that small villages.
Last year I was in America myself and the author and before him John Steinbeck visited a lot of places where I have been too and that makes it more intimate to read. It's as if I understand it better, even can see what he meens.
Great book, nice written, with humour. This is more than the memoires of someone travelling around the states. It has politics, religion, slavery, rights for black people, economics, jobs, big companies like GM and so on in it.
