Oh Sarah... what have you done to me?
This book... I have no words... it's just SO.DAMNED.GOOD!!!

Everything I didn't like about the first part of this series makes sense now and even though I stand by my review of it, I do get it was necessary to set up the plot for this book.

I didn't want to put this down, I finished this around midnight and had to force myself to actually go to sleep and not start the next (and last) book.
Can't wait to get back home, I know what I'll be doing tonight!
