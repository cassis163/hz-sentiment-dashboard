I loved rereading this series!
I've forgotten so many details and am so happy that I decided to read them again.

I feel this books is not only the conclusion to the Mortal Instruments, but also makes the perfect introduction to The Dark Artifices. I can't wait to start Lady Midnight and am glad the last part of the trilogy will be released this year, so I can continue, without the agony of having to wait a year for the conclusion :)
