Pick your poison is a book about a girl who is definitely a teenage girl no matter how smart she is. She is quick to judge on occasion, she lives by a certain set of rules that apply more strongly to teenagers than adults, she can not curb her curiosity in situations which she should, although don´t get me wrong that it does mostly work in her favor but she doesn´t think things through, and like many teenagers she is mostly reactionary. She doesn´t know when to pick her battles, that is for sure.
That makes her a perfect heroine though in this case, especially for teenagers because she isn´t perfect. She is smart but she can be a bit stupid about it regardless. However she does know how to keep her head cool and her wits in check when it is most needed. She could be a rolemodel for young girls because she is almost just like them, except for the being spy bit.
Pick your poison started in an extremely slow pace, hence the loss of a star but when it finally picked up speed it was much easier to get into the story. You understand the characters better. You understand Ruby better as well.
