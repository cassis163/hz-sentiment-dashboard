Shakespeare, Ibsen and a few other classics aside, is it a brilliant idea to publish a play's script as an addition to the book-series? Or is it just a clever way to make more money...? Let's say this is a nice little 'encore' to the Potter-world. A trip down memory lane with a few twists and turns for those who loved the books. Some characters get a litlle bit more depth and a few 'what-if's' are played out. A story about growing up, being a parent and living up to expectations. Those of others or your own.
