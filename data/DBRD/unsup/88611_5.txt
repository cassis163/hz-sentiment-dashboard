So this is Jeffrey Debris' second novel. What to say about it...

Let's just start with: WOW... I just finished reading it and I really think I need some time to fully process this. The story is great, thrilling even. Full of great characters (yes, we have been introduced to them more in this second book!) and unexpected twists in the plot.
The first book, The Shaedon Resurgence, Book I: The Fall of Netherea, I gave 4 stars and yes, I will need to give this second book 5 stars, definitely!
Please, Jeffrey, do not make the third novel even more fantastic, otherwise Hebban will need to add a sixth star!
