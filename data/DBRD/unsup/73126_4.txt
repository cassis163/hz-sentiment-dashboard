“Time was simple, is simple. We can divide it into simple parts, measure it, arrange dinner by it, drink whisky to its passage. We can mathematically deploy it, use it to express ideas about the observable universe, and yet if asked to explain it in simple language to a child–in simple language which is not deceit, of course–we are powerless. The most it ever seems we know how to do with time is to waste it.”

This is one of the most challenging, thought-provoking books I’ve read this year. It’s written extraordinary well and its content made my head spin several times. It’s not a book to rush through. I had to stop reading several times because it was a struggle to keep focusing. But it was definitely worth it. I would recommend this book to everybody who's interested in history and/or science.
