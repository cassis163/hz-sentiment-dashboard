4.5 glorious stars!

This story begins when 2 boys out hunting, come across 3 wizards and take a magical amulet from them.
Han, a former streetlord and all around cunning street rat, will do anything to support his mother and sister. He hunts with his clan friend, Fire Dancer and sells everything he finds in town.
When he was a baby, he had silver cuffs fitted on his wrist. They magically grow as he does and nobody seems to be able to get them off. He has no idea what they can do or what they are for.

Raisa is the spoiled princess heir and about to be of age. She is looking forward to her name day and the courting that is bound to happen.
She just came back from some time with her fathers clan, the Demonai and is trying to catch up with her studies, in order to be named the blooded heir on her name day.

When Han and Raisa's worlds meet, the adventure starts.

I absolutely loved this book!
It is a bit slow to start, the story builds up really gradually, but once it has its hooks in you, it won't let go until the book's over.
I normally like a faster pace, but in this case, I didn't mind it. It gave me time to fully immerse myself in the world and magic system.
This world... it's just so interesting!
A Queendom at the verge of war, forbidden magic, streetlords that rule gangs, clans... if that doesn't peak your interest, I don't know what will :)

The magic system itself is truly fascinating and I love the fact that this book acknowledges the fact that magical power can dangerous and sometimes needs to be kept in check.

This was the start of what can only be one epic journey and I'm here for it!
