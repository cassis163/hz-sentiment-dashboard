Actually I should have started with book 1 first but anyway
Colleen Hooverâ€™s talent for writing vivid and effortlessly beautiful stories is astounding. The level of emotions conveyed in each chapter just took my breath away over and over again. She has a gift for bringing everything to life with her words and can write even the simplest scene in such a way that the words just sink right into your heart.
Pain. Devastation. Love. Loss. Hope. Losing Hope. Finding Hope. Closure. This book has it all.
When I was finished reading I just sat there hugging my book, letting the emotions sink it, letting myself just FEEL.
Colleen Hoover's follow-up detailing Holder's heartfelt perspective is more than I even thought possible. Losing Hope takes us back to the moments that have influenced, affected and defined Dean Holder and the undeniable love he has for Hope...Sky.
As readers, we get so much more insight to Holder...the sum total of his experiences that connect you to the heart and soul of this beautiful character and this utterly amazing story.
Colleen Hoover is an exceptionally brilliant author with the ability to captivate and emotionally engage the reader through her powerful writing.

"When I touch you, I'm touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I'm kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I've ever seen and you know I can't not kiss it. And when I make love to you--I'm doing exactly that. I'm making love to you because I'm in love with you."

Hold on I need a "chapter break"....


Ms. Hoover, you are just that damn good
