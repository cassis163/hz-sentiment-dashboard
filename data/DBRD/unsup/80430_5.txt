This was a thrilling strange read.
I was lucky enough to find my copy in a thriftstore and despite having like, 60 other books waiting for me,
I couldn't help myself and started it right away.

We follow Mara after a very traumatic event in wich she lost her best friend, a friend of hers and Mara's boyfriend.
She and her family decide to move to another place and go to another school so that hopefully, Mara will be abble to
move on.

Although at times it made me LOL, the paranormal aspect of the story gave me the spoops.

I really liked everything, from story to the storytelling, needless to say I will continue with this series.
