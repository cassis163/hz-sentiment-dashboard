This second instalment in the Lunar Chronicles is still every bit as enjoyable as the first time I read it :)

We follow Scarlet. She is looking for her grandmother, who has gone missing. Scarlet has no idea what happened to her and she only gets her first clue when she runs into a streetfighter named Wolf.

Ah Wolf... you are just so rough around the edges, but I can't help wanting to snuggle with you <3
Wolf is what makes this novel my favorite I think. I just love him so much!
Scarlet is a kickass heroine, who fights with everything she's got to get her grandmother back.

I also really enjoy the friendly banter between Cinder and Thorne and I'm so glad IKO is back, she rocks!
