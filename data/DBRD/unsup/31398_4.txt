Reread March 2018

Wow, it doesn't happen a lot, but I totally stand by my earlier review of a book after re-reading it, but that happens to be the case for this one :)
The narrator for the audio book did a great job and I enjoyed listening to it a lot!

Only a month to go for the release of Leah on the offbeat, you better believe I'm pre-ordering it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After finishing Simon vs the Homosapiens agenda, I immediately went out and got this book.
I absolutely love the writing style of Becky Albertalli and wanted to read more!

Although this is a little slower of a start, I really liked it too.
The story follows Molly who has a lot of crushes, but hasn't been kissed yet. Her twin sister gets a girlfriend and suddenly, she feels she's falling behind...

The story is very cute and I identified with the main character Molly a lot, but at some points I just wanted to give her a kick in the arse and make her speak up!
Although I didn't love this book as much as I loved Simon, I still really enjoyed it and I hope Becky Albertalli writes a lot more books, I'm sure I'm going to read each and every one of them :)
