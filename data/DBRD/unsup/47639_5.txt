This book (and the second book in the series, Lord of Shadows) has been on my shelf for quite some time.
I was kind of scared to pick it up, because of all the hype about Lady Midnight.
Even though I did really enjoy The Mortal Instruments, I'm just not that in love with the series as a lot of other people seem to be, so I was a little scared I would feel the same about this book.
And I've heard there is quite the cliffhanger at the end of Lord of Shadows, so I wanted to wait until Queen of Air and Darkness was closer to its release date. Now that that is only a few months away, I decided it was time!

I loved this book so so much!
The characters are all so much more fleshed out, the plot felt a lot more realistic and the story sucked me in completely. Cassandra Clares writing has matured a lot and I connected with this story so much more than while reading TMI.
I felt all the emotions and my heart was broken... BROKEN! at the end of this book!

I already liked Emma and Julian in Heavenly Fire and I was glad to see I still did in Lady Midnight.
All the other characters crept their way into my heart just as much and I devoured this book, even though it is a big-ass book.

I just finished this today and I've already picked up Lord of Shadows... it's good I waited to read this, but it's still going to feel like a long wait until December...
