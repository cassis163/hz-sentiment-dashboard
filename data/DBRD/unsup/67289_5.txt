This book...

I don't want to say to much about the plot of this novel, because I really think it's best to go in blind, not knowing too much.
All I will say is that it's about time travel and it will blow your mind!

This novel made me think, re-think and than start all over again!
It kept me on the edge of my seat and I loved every weird, freaky, mindf*cking minute of it!

I need a minute to let everything sink in...

4.5*
