Oh, this book... this book is just... awesome!

I am a big fan of horror movies and this just read like a slasher film.
It was everything I hoped for.

We follow Quincy, a girl who was the sole survivor of a massacre. She went to a cabin in the woods with a group of friends, planning to have a good time, when they were attacked, horror movie style, by a killer she only refers to as Him.
After this horrible experience, Quincy becomes one of the Final Girls, a group of 3 girls who all survived a bloodbath.
Fast forward 10 years and Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep...

Halfway through I thought I knew what the twist at the end (there is ALWAYS a twist at the end in these kind of movie.... euh... books) was going to be and to be honest, I didn't like that one bit, even though I still enjoyed the book immensely.
Turns out: I WAS WRONG!
Pfieuw... bullet dogged, great book impression lives on!

If you love slasher / horror movies, you HAVE to read this!
