I have been avoiding this book for a long time, because it seemed like yet another story about an old man who does odd and unexpected things. Although this is exactly what the book is about, I'm glad that I gave it a try. I genuinely loved and enjoyed it from its immediately heartwarming and clever beginning to its touching end. The main character is a quirky, endearing anti-hero. While walking Harold confronts himself, his way of living, his beliefs and the choices he has made in the past. The book is as slow-paced as the walk Harold is making, but I was never bored or irritated. By giving his wife, Maureen a voice as well, the story becomes intriguing without getting too sentimental. The result is a bittersweet journey through an ordinary life, simultaneously absurd and realistic. Conclusion: a wonderful book that I definitely will recommend to others.
