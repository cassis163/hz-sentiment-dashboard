My rating: 3 of 5 stars

My first introduction of Aimee Carter was this book. At first glance, when picking up the book, I thought it had a lot of potential. The concept of numbered classes based on how well you did on the test you have to take when you turn seventeen, was quite original in its own way, although I can see comparisons with other books in this genre (e.g. Divergent). The performance based approach intrigued me, for I can understand why a government would pick intelligent people for more important jobs.

The secrets that come to light when Kitty is placed in the highest class, one you only get into when you're blood-related of the Hart family, set the pace of the story. The middle part of the book, however, felt a bit slow-going. Also, I was not sure what to think of the sort-of-beginning-of-a-love triangle (which will probably get more attention in the next books). If that's going the way I think it is going, it would crush the (somewhat) original feel I got with this book.

However, several surprising revelations, the imaginable actions of Kitty (she was no superhero, but just a 'normal' girl) and the suspense at the ending of the book made up for that. Therefore, I give this book 3+ stars, cautiously optimistic about the second part.
