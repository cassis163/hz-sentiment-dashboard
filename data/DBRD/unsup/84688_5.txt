“A very well fitting sequel, leaving you to wanting more…again!”

Thanks to the writer, Brian S. Ference, himself I had the chance to read this second novel in ‘The Wolf of Dorian Gray’ series. Which I didn’t mind at all cause I loved the first one and was very curious about this sequel.

Actually I couldn’t wait to read how Dorian would carry on after being eaten alive. What does it mean for him, his loved ones and his already timeless life. Where to flee when the killing spree of the werewolf starts? Will enlisting to the Royal Navy, fleeing England and fighting overseas bring him peace, love and serenity?

I have read this second novel about Dorian Gray with great pleasure. Just like in the first book the used writing style perfectly fits the time, sphere and events in the storyline. The whole story comes over realistically in the timeline chosen for. The fighting scenes are made visually through words and kept interesting by using the feelings of the main characters during these fights. As a reader I could easily sympathize with Dorian, Van Helsing and other important characters in this book. Cause as a reader you crawl in the heads of the characters, feel their emotions and see through their eyes. Due to that you learn to know them very well. The whole story had my full attention and I wasn't bored at all, not even a second.

I give this book 5 stars.
