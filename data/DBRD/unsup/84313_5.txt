This book is a worthy read for anyone with an interest in retro games and other 80's related things. Those who read Ready player one might be disappointed to hear that this is not a contination of the Ready player one, but don't go just yet ! This book is a worthy read aswell! Although many might think that no book could ever be better then Ready player one... Well I am speechless this one is as good if not a lot better. It is a completely new world, with a great story line featuring many of the familiar things from my childhood. It makes you think and wish the story was real. As not many books out there can suck you in from page one, this one does. It involves plot twishing storytelling worthy of a tabletop right like DnD . Even Gygax would be proud of this writer as nobody I have ever read has reached this level of geek in not one but 2 books ! It involves the defense of planet earth, where Gamers like you and me would love to be recruited for. Unlike Pixels this is a more believable story, with more realistic plot lines. I really recommend this book for your private library. It is worth every penny and has earned it'seems place as my nr.1 best read of all time.
