Re-read March 2018

Oh, this was so good!
I loved all the action and the overall plot-line, but my favorite part is the introduction of the new characters. Aedion, Lysandra, Manon, Elide... I've been waiting for them to join the party :D

The only thing I didn't like in this book, is the way Chaol's character is broken down.
He is one of my favorites and in this book, he just becomes an... well... asshole!
Luckily, he gets over it, but boy, was he annoying!

On to Empire of Storms!

I loved this series so much! I do think the books get better as the story evolves and the first book is my least favorite, but still... I couldn't put any of them down and they all get a 5 star review!
If you haven't read anything by Sarah J. Maas, pick up one of her books asap!
