Zes jaar geleden, toen dit boek uitkwam, zou het wellicht meer indruk op me hebben gemaakt, maar nu... Ik denk dat Baker erg, erg boos was toen hij dit boekje schreef. Dat spat nog steeds van de pagina's af, maar niet op een manier dat het, zes jaar later, nog echt iets losmaakt. Op een enkele uitzondering na:

Ben:... What? What? What is it?
Jay: Oh, just remembering. Three men are standing on a bombed-out hillside in the mountains in Afghanistan. Do you recall that episode? They're loading up a camel with some shrapnel that they've gathered to sell for scrap across the border in Pakistan. They're scavangers. Finally here's something American that actually helps them survive - the bomb shrapnel itself. A gift from the skies. And then a Predator attack drone flies by, mmmmmmmmmm, very slow, mmmmmmmmmm, odd-looking plane, headless, and its camera gets a fix on them, and it turns, mmmmmmmmmm, and some CIA drone jockey sitting in front of a screen sipping lemonade thinks, Woo Nelly, tall guys, long beards, robes - robes? ROBE ALERT, ROBE ALERT, ROBE ALERT, one Adam-Twelve, men wandering on the hills near the caves! Al Qaeda operatives! Could be mr. Bin himself! So the CIA guy takes another sip of lemonade, pushes a few buttons, and suddenly the three men see this flare of a Hellfire missile, they hear the hiss of it, and they pause, and for some curious reason it's coming toward them, it curves a little, it seems to know where they are, and boom, shreds of blood and tissue, moaning people. I knew, I knew when those towers came down, I knew we would be bombing somewhere very soon. It's what we do. We get as far away as we possibly can and then we deliver the goods.

Aardig boekje, maar het heeft het verstrijken van de jaren niet doorstaan....
