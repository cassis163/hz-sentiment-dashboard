Well, lessons were learned. When you receive an ARC in your subscription box that everyone seems hyped about, please Patty do learn, don't wait 6 months before reading it...
This is like the fifth time that I did not want to know anything about the hype and ended up feeling stupid for that.

We read the book throughout 2 perspectives; Rielle who lives in the past and Eliana who lives in the present, roughly a thousand years apart.
Somehow these story lines are connected with each other via a fight/war that doesn't take place in this book but the event as well as the consequences play a big part in both of their lives.

Story: 4/5 , want more!
Characters: 4/5 , There were some I liked more than others, but a good balance overall.
Writing: 4/5 , it was really easy to emerge in the world.
Reread: Yes, definitely. I would love to read all Rielle's chapters in one go and then do the same with Eliana's.

I am really looking forward to the next book in this trilogy, I am ready to dive deeper into this world and it's history.
