The story continues...
After the boring City of Fallen Angels, this was a breath of fresh air.

In this book, Lillith, the mother of all demons, has bound Jace to Jonathan (Sebastian, whatever name you prefer to call him). He has no free will and not only does he agree with all Jonathans plans, he thinks they are the only way to go.
Of course Clary wants nothing more than to rescue him and she and the rest of the gang (Simon, Isabelle, Alec and Magnus) do everything in their power to make sure Jace gets out of this sticky situation.

This was, again, slow to start. The story only really picked up 3/4 through the book, but I the actual plot was a lot better than in the last book. Things actually happened!

“I hope you told him you were bitten by a gay spider.”

Simon makes me laugh so much... he got some kick ass action and FINALLY... a deserving love interest... GO SIMON *\o/*

Even though I already read the last part of this series, I'm still excited to read the conclusion to this story :D
