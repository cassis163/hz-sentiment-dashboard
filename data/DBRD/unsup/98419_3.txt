Why is this a hype? Is it the writing or is it the message? I think last. Quick read, like you're on a rollercoaster you can't get out of. But the end is rushed and the characters are very flat. Still I think it's a good thing this book is so hyped. Makes people think where we could be headed if we stop being sensible and just follow the masses in our mindless opinions. Social media is not the enemy. Not thinking is.
