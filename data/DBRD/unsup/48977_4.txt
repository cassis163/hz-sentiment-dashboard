The story is a modern Easter story, a smoothly written book for young people aged 10 and up. We get to know the realm of the hares that is ruled by King Stern.The youngest brother of Stern, called Atta, leaves the empire to search for his own light realm. He hopes to be there with the pregnant Homage and their unborn child. going to live. Atta leaves but then the hares baby comes too early. Tribute calls her Ebba. Ebba is an eager to learn hare and has a spike to her boat. She is very unhappy in the land of the hares. One day she finds an abandoned bird’s nest with eggs in it and Ebba wants to go on an adventure like her father. She wants to return the eggs to the mother bird and goes on an adventure with permission from Hulde. The road to the light kingdom is not without danger. Would Ebba be just as brave as her father and her light-hearted? You have to read that yourself.
The story reads smoothly and the chapters are not too long. There is also a lot of humor. The writer makes frequent use of all sorts of proverbs that contain “hare”, which I find very funny.
I find the name of the chick masterfully. You can easily move around in the characters, it is a youth book.
At the end of the story it is clear why Ebba has become the first Easter bunny.
It is a well-written, modern fairytale with enough ingredients to be able to read it immediately. The target group is certainly suitable. Adults can appreciate it if you like humor and fairy tales.

Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
