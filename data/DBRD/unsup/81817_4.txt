Lovers of the magical world, this is a mustread for you!

Molly and Alexis are best friends. When Molly goes missing, Alexis is determined to find her. She'll do anything, even make a deal with one of the fae.

Somehow the story has a slow start - I am referring to the part in the beginning of the book, where they still are in the human world, introducing Molly and Alexis-, but it might as well be my impatience to go to the Faery Realm! Having said that, it quickly absorbed me when Alexis makes the deal with the fae. So much so, that I was reluctant to put the book away to go grocery shopping (food which is awfully dull compared with the Faery Realm) or cook a meal.

Alexis got her hands full with everything that is going on, finding Molly is not as straightforward as she thought!

Exiting read, leaving you wanting for more!
