As this book is thinner and shorter than most of kings other work, the characters are a bit flatter than usual. But the story is definetly a true gem.

A pleasant revisiting of Castle Rock and references to characters and elements of other stories are always enjoyable for me. The concept of loosing weight without slimming reminds a bit of 'thinner', a book King wrote as Bachman. This is actually more a feelgood book than a real horror story, but it would'nt be King if there wasn't a supernatural element to it. Though a somewhat happy ending, it left me feeling a bit sad.

The version I read contained an extract from 'Gwendy's button box', I feel it would have been better to put both stories in 1 volume (maybe with other shorts?)
