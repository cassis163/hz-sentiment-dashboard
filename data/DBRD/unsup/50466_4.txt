The Richardsons live a quite, suburban life in Shaker heights.
They have a nice, big house and even own a smaller house, they rent out.

Their quite life is turned upside down when an unmarried mother and her daughter move into the rental and the lives of both families intertwine.

Little Fires Everywhere is not only beautifully written, but the build up of the plot is done expertly.
Even though the story unfolds quietly, it has so many unexpected twists and turns, I could not put this down (but I had to, as I buddy read it).

It's by no means a fast paced book, but everything is so well thought out and the way the separate plotlines connect... just pure brilliance!

I loved everything about this book and will definitely recommend!
