A boy named Miles ''Pudge'', and he is abandoning his family for boarding school, and in the time he left, he experienced a lot in his personal daily life. For example his first friends, kiss and a ''beautiful'' girl called Alaska.

Then he falls in love with one of the closest friends Alaska, and it's very hard for Pudge because Alaska has already a boyfriend. Alaska wants him to date with a girl named Lara, but we all know that he is only in love for Alaska, and not some other girl.

The book is part before the kiss, and part after the kiss. As a reader you can experience the difference between both scenes. In almost the end of the book, there will happen a unexpected tragedy, personalitys that will come out of the shadow, without even met them. Reading all those bookcharacteurs is well interesting, because you don't know what their emotions are for real, and they may be acting there is nothing wrong.
