No, I am not going to give away any part of this story, because I don't want to spoil your trip through this awesome thriller. Reading Nesbo always is an adventure in itself and I savored every page and every moment I was reading.
I must warn you though: a book like this,in fact every book I read of this author, is bound to keep you awake for hours during the night, because it is next to impossible to put it away before you finished the last paragraph.
