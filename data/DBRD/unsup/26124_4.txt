I knew I shouldn't have gone into that bookstore and I knew I shouldn't have gone to the section with English books. And I knew I shouldn't have picked up this book for the fourth time or so. And I knew I shouldn't haven taken it home, but I heard so much about the Eliza counterpart of this book and it just made me really curious and that was the beginning of my downfall.

I started reading as soon as I was home and I finished the book within about three hours, probably even less. The writing style was so pleasant and easy, that I could read through the book with more than about 120 pages an hour I think. And the book kept me glued to the pages from start to finish.

Just like most people, I only know Mary because of the legends, because of how the stories about her are told. What I loved about this book, was how the book treated Mary as a person, as girl growing up in a messed up world, with churches fighting over marriages, princesses and queens. Despite the fact that Mary is born as a princess, forced to become a lady, before she becomes a queen eventually, her story is filled with normal girls problems.

I love how the story speaks about her longing for her parents to be parents, how she wants siblings, but also doesn't want to disappoint her mother, how she wants friends, but is proven time after time that trusting people in her position isn't wise or right. I love how, despite the situation being so uncommon, it was so easy to understand Mary and the girl she grew up to become.

All in all: It's a very nice read, that helps to see past the bloody Mary image and it makes me really curious to read the other books by Lucy Worsley!
