Last saterday, i read this delightful book by Jackie van Laren. Duingras is the first out of four books of the Island series. A delicious feel-good vibe where you feel the warmth of the personalities till the last page of the book. For me this is a five star book! Iâ€™ll try to start as soon as possible in the second part of the Island series.
