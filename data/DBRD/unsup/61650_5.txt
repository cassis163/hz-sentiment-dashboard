"People spoke of love as if it was an arrow. A thing that flew quick, and always found its mark. They spoke of it as if it were a pleasant thing, but Maxim had taken an arrow once, and knew it for what it was: excruciating."

I wasn’t planning on picking this up straight after I finished A Gathering of Shadows, but after that ending, I knew I needed to continue asap.
Luckily, this book seamlessly picks up after the previous one.

The story of Kell, Lila, Rhy, Alucard and all four Londons continues and comes together in this epic conclusion.
Even though I loved every second spend reading this book and am so happy I know how the story ends, I’m incredibly sad it’s over.

I loved the plotline and the way Victoria Schwab wrapped everything up. The pacing of the story was perfect, a lot happened and it kept you on the edge of your seat, but you also got time to take a breath and try to figure things out for yourself.

I’ve fallen in love with the writing style and although I have many passages I love, I absolutely adore the quote I mentioned above. It comes from one of the most beautiful, albeit incredibly sad parts of the book and it mad me feel all the feels.

This books (and series in general) deserves all the hype and if you haven’t read it, I highly recommend you do!
