It was good, but not as good as the first one.

The thing that bugged me most was that they kept repeating the same damn things. How she felt so bad about not minding the t-rexes to die and how bad that made her feel. How linc wanted to save his sister and that was his only job, etc. They kept repeating that and like cmon i get it!!!!

The pacing was good, i enjoyed again the different parts that the book had so you just had to keep on reading. I feel like book 3 will be much better than this one because the ending was great and gave the sequel much potential.

Didnt really like jesa, i felt like she was too much of a burden constantly only worried about her dad and wanting to see her dad. I was way more interested in the other characters and their storylines, probably because they've been with us longer, so you really start to get a bond with them.

Also, linc is always the damn victim. He's so unlucky. I feel so bad for him constantly being the victim of the dinos. First his leg, then his shoulder, now his back. And then poor leif, i was so scared he was gonna die. Reban is also a very interesting character, im curious to see the relationship between him and storm to evolve now that theyre alone on the continent.

I honestly felt suprised, i never had the feeling i would know what would happen next which is good. The book also keeps you hanging with so many questions that have yet been answered and i hope that is what will happen in book three. Im so excited to finish this series and i cant wait for the next one.

Anyone any idea when the next book will be out?
