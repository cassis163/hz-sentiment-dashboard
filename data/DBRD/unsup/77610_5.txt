Yep ... Seanan McGuire did it again. She crafted an entertaining, weird and dark fantasy story with again a deeper message that reveals a lot of truths about the reality we live in. She touches upon subjects like gender stereotyping, what it means to be a girl in this day and age and how most of us have to go to a very dark please to emerge as our authentic selves ... in this case quite litterally.

The second installment of the Wayward Children trilogy is basically a pre-quel to Every heart a doorway. This book dives deeper into the wondrous and dark world Jack and Jill fell into at age twelve before they ended up in Eleanor West's home for Wayward Children.

If possible, the writing style is even more exquisite than it was in the first book and really befits this tale. It's without a doubt a 5 star read.
