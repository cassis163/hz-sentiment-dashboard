I hesitated a long time whether I would buy the book or not. So I read it from someone else. It seems to be a script, so it also looks out. But if you read, it is still just a story. It reads very easy way, despite being English. On some pieces, I laughed so hard, I at first could not imagine my own. The eighth installment of Harry Potter is not a Harry Potter story about Harry, but more about his son Albus Severus and Scorpius. The story is very nice and it must have just on your bookshelf, it is unfortunate that the script Flashy so little. To read more about them, but anyone can guess. This unfortunately did not happen.

Although the characters who play games in the theater does not resemble, at least not all. I'm still very curious about the theater piece itself.
