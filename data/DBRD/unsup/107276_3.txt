Gelezen maart 2008.
Dit boek heb ik in het Engels gelezen (The Jane Austen Book Club), vandaar mijn reactie in het Engels: This was a nice read, but nothing more than that I'm afraid. The book was mostly about the problems, loves and lives of the six participants in the book club, but I learned nothing new on Jane Austen and her books. I could not relate to any of the book club members, the characters remained on the surface; no deeper emotions or feelings.
