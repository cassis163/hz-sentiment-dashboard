I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.

OMG this book is.... there are no words for it. This book is AMAZING. And the epilogue, wow. I loved every word. This book left me with a big smile and tears streaming down my face, in a very good way.

Rebecca Yarros proved again what an amazing writer she is. She makes you feel everything tge characters are feeling.

I loved Nova and especially Wilder very, very much, but I think Rebel is my favorite.

Rebel is the third and last installment in an amazing trilogy about the Renegades. Rebel is the only original female Renegade and I loved that this book was about her. And Cruz was very swoon worthy.
