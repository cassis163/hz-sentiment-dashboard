This is an epic Japanese fantasy about a girl who doesn't quite fit in.
Her adventure starts, when she discovers her mother has a special ability and can communicate with animals.

I'm so conflicted about this book.
On the one hand, it was very unique, with well developed characters, a gripping plotline and the writing was beautiful.

On the other hand, the info dumping really bugged me...
I understand that it was all extremely relevant information, but it just didn't hold my attention.

And the fact that on several occasions, Elin told the story of the big, life changing catastrophe and everybody is in shock about it, but we don't find out what it is until the very last chapter...
It made me a little mad to be honest.

If the other books will be translated, I will definitely continue, because I did really like the story, there were just a few thinks about this book that irked me.
