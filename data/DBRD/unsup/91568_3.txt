After previously reading the 9th book of #dorkdiaries series, I immediately decided to read the whole series in 2019, starting with the first one of the series.

What was your favorite lipgloss? How did you handle a new school and how did you react when having your first crush? These are really important topics that Nikki has at this stage of her life.

Again this is a three star rating for this book, I really love to read the thoughts of Nikki that she wrote down in her diaries.
