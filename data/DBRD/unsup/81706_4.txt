It has taken me quite some time before I started reading this book. I already saw the movie, which kind of ruined some of the story, but I still really enjoyed the book. The characters and the whole world is described nicely and the dialogues are filled with mystery and humor. It is a book full of adventure, mystery, and friendship. The combination of old myths and Greek mythology with adventure gives a book that is hard to put down. I canâ€™t wait to read the rest of the series.
