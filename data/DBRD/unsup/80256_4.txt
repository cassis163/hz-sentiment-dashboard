Decided to pick up this Philip K Dick short story collection in preperation of the upcoming tv series. Thought it would be fun to familiarize myself with the source material before watching any of the adaptations. It turned out to be a surprisingly pleasurable read.
Because the themes of all Philip K Dick’s stories are still very current the tales didn’t come across as dated as I thought they would. But they do have that old skool Twilight Zone vibe which I happen to love. This however does not translate to the TV series, all the episodes in the anthology are clearly 2018 productions.

The audiobook does sound like a 50’s recording. The only reminder that you are in fact listening to a new recording is the introduction written by every director in which he/she discusses why he/she chose to adapt a particular story. The audiobook is kinda overkill but for me it always elevates the reading experience. Awarded the book and audiobook 4 stars cause this is a cool read even if you don’t get to watch the TV series.
