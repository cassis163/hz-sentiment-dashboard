As a Lebanese I enjoyed the stories by Martijn van der Kooij very much. I saw my country through foreigners eyes and that's refreshing! His stories are well written and he is well informed. Some info (hidden synagogue) even surprised me.
I loved the photos and personal advice where to go. I would advice foreigners to buy Lebanon 24/7!
