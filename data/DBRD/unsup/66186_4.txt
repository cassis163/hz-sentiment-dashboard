I love to read Katie Fforde with a feelgood novel. My life and work are quite busy and I just like to cuddle up on the couch and read a book that I know will end happy. No heavy literature but a nice book which makes me feel okay. And yes, the fun is to read it in English. Because to read in the original language is a great treat!!
