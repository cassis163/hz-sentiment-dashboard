a contemporary reworking of Sophocles
nn Sophocles’s play Antigone a teenage girl is forced to choose between obeying the law of the land (her uncle, the king of Thebes, has forbidden the burial of a traitor) and religious law (the traitor is Antigone’s brother, Polynices, who has declared war on his city, and killed his own brother, Eteocles, along the way)
Brilliant, beautiful, and full of irony, Shamsie's story eclipses Sophocles' original. A principled young woman (Aneeka-Antigone), devoted to her erring brother (Parvaiz- Polynices), seeks to bury his body. Her practical sister (Isma-Ismene) urges moderation and compromise. Orphans of a tragic father (Pasha-Oedipus), the siblings' fates are entwined with each other, and with power politics (British animus for Muslims and Pakistanis, in Home Fire).
A narcissistic, ambitious politician (Karamat-Creon) opposes the brave woman, in his pride and insecurity. Her lover (Eamonn-Haemon), the politician's son, eloquently pleads to his father on her behalf. His wife (Teresa-Eurydice) appeals to the politician's best self, his needs, and his desires. The media-chorus reflects popular judgments. Love and loyalty are compelling, in diverse relationships, but pride leads to tragedy, inevitably.
Shamsie's characters are richly developed and complex - especially the sisters. The women are strong and intelligent, passionate and dignified. Social tensions and cultural conflicts deepen the reader's empathy and understanding. This book is a pleasure, in language and imagery, intellectually and emotionally.
She tells the stories of Pakistani immigrants, some of whom seem to be fully assimilated in British society, and others who reject the society they live in, and even work against it. But of course life is much more complicated than we see and hear it on the news, and that's what makes this novel work--it successfully highlights the complexities of human nature. What seems obvious, isn't always that obvious. The novel keeps you engaged till the end with unexpected outcomes and situations.
