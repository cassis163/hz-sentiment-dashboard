Monty is a rich, entitled English son of a Duke... Earl... I can't seem to remember the proper title...
He drinks a lot, sleeps with both woman and men (totally illegal in the 18th century) and basically takes no responsibility at all for... well... anythingn really.
When he sets out for a Tour across the Continent with his sister Felicity and his best friend Percy (who he's secretly in love with), he expects to have a gay old time drinking and doing not much else.
What ends up happening is a bit more than Monty bargained for...

This book was nice and the writing was funny.
I enjoyed reading it, but I wasn't completely in love with it, like so many people seem to be.
Monty is a bit of a douche to be honest and Percy wasn't as fleshed out as I like my characters to be.
I did see some change in Monty during the story, but I thought it could have been even more.

I did really enjoy the adventure in this book and reading about all the familiar sites in Europe but my absolute favorite thing in this book, was Felicity.
Her snarky comments (come on, high five for mentioning her period in a total sarcastic way!) were a joy to read and I thought she was a kick ass, firecracker.
I can't wait to read about more of her adventures!
