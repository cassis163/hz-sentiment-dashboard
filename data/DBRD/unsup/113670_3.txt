I don't know what to make of this book. The story was interesting and well written. But the culprit and the why were already early on in the story clear. So no real surprises there. The book stops somewhere in the middle when it just may become a bit more interesting. But I've got a fairly good idea how the story will progress. It's really just part 1 in a larger story (that other writers tell in just 1 larger book!) I understand that this is a mere marketing technique where you get the first book for free and each sequell costs just a bit more than the last. Well, sometimes I've fallen for it because I thought it worthwhile. In this case I'll only read on as it remains free.
