The story continues in this second installment. Again, we follow Clary as she finds her way in the Shadowhunters world. Things get complicated when downworld children are getting killed...

The story was well developed and I did like the fact that we got a bit more action, but even with that, it still felt very slow to start to me.

I did enjoy the characters a lot more, Clary finally stepped up and started to rely on her own brain to make decisions, instead of just going along with everybody else, Jace still isn't my favorite, I mean, come on! you find out somebody is your sister and you don't care, you still want to be her boyfriend??? Ick... and I would have liked to see more of Magnus, Isabelle and Alec in this book, they were there, but only on the sidelines.
Simon still is my favorite character, I like how honest he is and he's just so deliciously quirky :)

Overall an enjoyable read, on to the next one :D
