Again Michael Grant has proven itself with the first part of Messenger of Fear. The beginning was confused weird, but as soon as you know where it is exactly. It is easy to read and the font is legible. Sometimes I did not understand well what Michael wanted now with this book, but it is a great book to read. Say a Feelgood.
