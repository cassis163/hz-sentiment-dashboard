Before I bought this book I had read some comments. In some this book was compared with The World According to Garp. Some elements are indeed the same: the wrestling, the main character that is a writer and the tolerance for everything that is not a normal man-woman relation. That's where the comparison ends. I'm a fan of John Irving, read all his books more than once. In One Person is a good book, but nothing more. I had bigger expectations mainly because it was compared with The World According to Garp. Now that is a great book. Perhaps Irving needs some new setting in his next book, away from schools, teachers, wrestling and main characters with a bit less issues with sexs. I mean it's great that he tries to start a duscussion about being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, ... and that he pleas for tolerance, but I don't know if this book will be the answer.
