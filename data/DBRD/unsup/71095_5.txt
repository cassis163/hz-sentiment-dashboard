This book... I have no words...
It's even better than Six of Crows and I absolutely loved that one!

Crooked Kingdom dives deeper into the backstory of the characters I came to know and love in Six of Crows and explains more about why they are the way they are and their reasons for doing things a certain way.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, it's a fast paced, action packed novel that is, dare I say it, the best book I've read in 2017 so far!

It made me laugh, cry and feel all the feels and don't even get me started on that ending... I'm going to need a minute to get over that!

What a book, what an author!

If you haven't read this duology yet, do it! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!
