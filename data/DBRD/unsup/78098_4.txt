This is a very strange story to be pulled into, but that was exactly what happened. The story amazed me and followed me around in-between reading sessions. I started reading this book without much information about it. Lucky me, if I had known, I probably never would have given it a chance. It’s impossible to summarize its content without giving too much away or scaring other readers off, so I’ll keep it brief: read this book and let Faber’s magic do its work.
