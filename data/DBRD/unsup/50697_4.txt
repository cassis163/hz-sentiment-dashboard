Impressive story. The way both main characters are dealing with the racism is very understandable. It is really crushing to read about it. It makes me want to do something against it. And I guess that's what makes this book so meaningful. It can help you to look at racism from another direction and it can teach you how to recognize it in your own life.

During the book, I sometimes noticed that my attention wasn't completely on the story. Some parts were a bit slow. But the ending definitely made up for that!
