While the Rosie Project was full of laugh-out-loud observations, its sequel is more cynical. It’s still entertaining, but far less hilarious. Especially the character of Rosie has changed a lot and lost all her charm. As a result, the Rosie Project’s happy magic was nowhere to be found in this book. As the plot unfolded, some scenes seemed to drag on a bit, slowing down the pace. I still enjoyed reading this book, but I wasn't wowed.
