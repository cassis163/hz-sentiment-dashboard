This was such a weird book... I had so many moments that I was utterly confused and had no idea what direction the story would go, but... I kept on reading, I had to know how it would end.

The story is basically a girl, telling about her new boyfriend taking her to visit the farm where he grew up and meeting his parents for the first time.
We, the reader, get to follow along.

I picked up some clues how the story would turn out while reading this book, but even though I was thinking in the right direction, the twist at the end still managed to surprise me.

I thought it was well executed and totally weird... in a good way.

I do get why people don't like this though.
It's definitely not a book for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot.
