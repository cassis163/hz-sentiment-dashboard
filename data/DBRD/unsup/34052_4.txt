I used to watch the tv show with Helen Mirren as Jane Tennison, and it was so nice to read this book of who she was at the beginning of her career. Her character was well written, I loved the small details about her way of thinking plus the interaction with her and her colleagues. And of course all the silly things about men being unhappy about having women at the police station.

Too bad, Hellen Mirren is too old to be playing this early part of the career of Jane Tennison.

Thanks to BookishFirst and the publisher for a copy of the book
