This is not a book to rush, but to savor and think about. It’s a fascinating exploration of people’s responsibility towards family, friends and strangers. The prose is fluent and sharp, the story richly layered. Even though the characters felt strange and different from what I’m used to, I was drawn into their world almost immediately. A thought-provoking story about loyalty, love and loss. Put it on your to-read-list.
