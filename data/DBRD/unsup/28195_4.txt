3,5 stars: I liked the characters, the style, the pace, the story and yet... Sometimes you read a book that really hits home. Then you start reading more of the author's books and this is when the problems start. That one book remains the touchstone, no matter how hard you try to be objective. I'm afraid that 'Me before You' will keep doing this to all Moyes' books. Jojo Moyes writes clever, funny chicklit that questions modern life and I like almost everything she writes. But because of that one book I will always expect just that little bit more. Which is why I was disappointed that, despite a lot of realistic, harsh parts, the overall storyline was too predictable, the characters too likeable, the tone too fluffy. The result is a fun, well written, yet not memorable novel. Conclusion: â€˜The One plus One' is good, but 'Me before you' is better.
