Peter Piot heeft in het instituut voor tropische geneeskunde gewerkt, waar ik zelf momenteel ook werk.
Fascinating book. Written by 'just an ordinary guy from the Kempen' who made it to director of USAID. It's nice to recognize names of colleagues who work or worked at the Institute of Tropical Medicine. The first part of the book was the most interesting, where Peter Piot works in the field, has to improvise a lot. The second part is more about finding his way in the bureaucracy and walking on several wires at the same time to keep everyone satisfied, to compromise. He has dined with the greatest of the world, has travelled to places he didn't know existed. I bet he looks back at his life with pried for what he achieved, but also sad that he couldn't do more. A Great Belgian Person.
