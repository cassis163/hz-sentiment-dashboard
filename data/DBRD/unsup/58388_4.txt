This is an impressive book. I learned a lot about Pakistan, the Swat Valley and the life in her town. The story how her father and Malala strive for the right to go to school for everyone is impressive. When she is shot, politics almost prevented her from going abroad to get the best health. It's sad that the Taliban see her as an enemy, she is just a girl who want a school for everyone.
