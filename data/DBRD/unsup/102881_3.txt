On the first three pages I found several oddly spelled words and strange sentences. I admit that English is not my first language but neither did I write a book in the language. Overlooking this I must say that I enjoyed the story, although I couldn't understand the strange behaviour of the main character in the last chapter. The detective didn't stand out as a real person, I hope this gets better in the sequels
