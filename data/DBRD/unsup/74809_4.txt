This story combines realistic elements with idealistic, over-the-top events, a wonderful combination for a relaxing read. The book is filled with superb, recognizable and - as a parent - at times quite confrontational dialogues. Moreover, it has an excellent structure, I liked how the reader, in alternating chapters, is taken back and forth in the Douglasâ€™ life. Halfway through the novel, I was pretty sure of how the story would end. Luckily, the ending turned out to be different from what I expected. In short, I couldn't put this book down.
