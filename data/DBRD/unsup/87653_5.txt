This book really got to me. It is beautifully written, pure, sober and realistic. You feel the autor is writing (parts of) her own story. You can understand why many (young) people cut or burn themselves. I think this is a very important book and I hope many people will read it so they know they are not alone or they get more compassion for the ones who hurt so much inside.
The story is about Charley Davis. Her father commited suicide and her mother ’left’ mentally. Charley is hurt to much by this neglect: she start to drink, to use drugs and to cut herself. In this book you follow her from the clinck to the (more hopeful???) end. The note from the author at the end made me even cry. She is so open about her own pain and process. Her message is something many people need in this world: find the right people, find the people who will support you, find your ‘tribe’ and finally find your true purpose in life, your skill, yous passion.
I am very grateful my bookclub, the bored to death bookclub in Rotterdam, choose this book to read.......
