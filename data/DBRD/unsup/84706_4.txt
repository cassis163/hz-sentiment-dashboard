I can see that this was supposed to be the last book in the trilogy and I really liked the "ending"

Clary and her Shadowhunter friends travel to the City of Glass in order to save Clary's mother and find a way to beat Valentine once and for all.

Now this is how you do a Shadowhunter book :)
Actionpacked, fast paced and every single character gets a nice bit of attention!
This is definitely my favorite of the series so far!
