This was enjoyable, but it did suffer a little from the fact that it wasn't supposed to be written in the first place.
This series was only supposed to be a trilogy and it showed in the rather slow pacing of this fourth installment.

I did really love the fact that Simon played a major part in this book.
Finally, he gets the attention he deserves :D

Overall, a nice story, but nothing that blew my mind, it kind of felt like just more of the same...
